# ZIPCODES Specification

**Name**: zipcodes

---

# HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE

## CRITICAL: Template File is READ-ONLY

**The template file (this file) is READ-ONLY. NEVER modify it directly.**

The template file may be named:
- `TEMPLATE.md` (standard)
- `SPEC.md` (legacy)
- `CLAUDE.md` (legacy)
- Or any other name containing specification content

**How to identify the template file:**
- Contains `zipcodes`, `apimgr` variables (not replaced)
- Contains "HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE" section
- Contains multiple "PART X:" numbered sections
- Much larger than a typical project AI.md

**Template file location is flexible:**
- Project root
- Organization root
- Different organization entirely
- Home directory (`~/`)
- Any other location the user specifies

## File Types

| File | Location | Purpose | Modify? |
|------|----------|---------|---------|
| **Template file** | Organization/shared | Master specification | **NEVER** |
| **AI.md** | Each project repo | Project specification | **YES** |
| **TODO.AI.md** | Each project repo | Task tracking | **YES** |

## File Workflow

```
Template File (read-only, organization-level)
     │
     ├── AI.md missing? ────► Copy template to AI.md, replace variables
     │
     ├── AI.md exists? ─────► Update AI.md to reflect template changes
     │
     └── Old files exist? ──► Merge into AI.md, DELETE old files
           (CLAUDE.md, SPEC.md in project repo)
```

## For New Projects

1. **Copy template file** to your project as `AI.md`
2. **Replace all variables** with your project values:
   - `zipcodes` → your project name (e.g., `jokes`)
   - `apimgr` → your organization (e.g., `apimgr`)
   - `ZIPCODES` → uppercase project name (e.g., `JOKES`)
   - `{gitprovider}` → your git host (e.g., `github`)
3. **Fill in project-specific sections**:
   - PART 2: Project Description and Features
   - PART 30: Project-Specific API Endpoints, Data Files, Configuration
4. **Delete this "HOW TO USE" section** from AI.md after setup
5. **Create required files**: AI.md, TODO.AI.md, README.md, LICENSE.md

## For Existing Projects

1. **Check for AI.md** - if missing, create from template
2. **Migrate old spec files** (if they exist in project repo):
   - `CLAUDE.md` → merge into `AI.md`, **DELETE**
   - `SPEC.md` → merge into `AI.md`, **DELETE**
3. **Audit existing code** against AI.md specification
4. **Document gaps** in TODO.AI.md

# AI ASSISTANT INSTRUCTIONS (READ THIS ENTIRE SECTION)

## CRITICAL: Specification Drift Prevention

**AI assistants have a tendency to "drift" from specifications over time.** This means gradually deviating from documented requirements, inventing new patterns, or forgetting constraints. **This is unacceptable.**

### The Problem

| Drift Type | Example | Impact |
|------------|---------|--------|
| **Pattern drift** | Using different file structure than specified | Inconsistency across projects |
| **Naming drift** | Using different variable/function names | Code doesn't match spec |
| **Feature drift** | Adding unrequested features | Over-engineering, bugs |
| **Constraint drift** | Forgetting NON-NEGOTIABLE rules | Specification violations |
| **Format drift** | Using different date/version formats | Integration failures |

### The Solution: Constant Re-verification

**You MUST re-read relevant spec sections before EVERY implementation.**

```
BEFORE writing ANY code:
1. Identify which PART(s) of the spec apply
2. Re-read those sections completely
3. Verify your planned implementation matches EXACTLY
4. If ANY deviation is needed, ASK first
5. NEVER assume you remember correctly - ALWAYS re-check
```

## Mandatory Compliance Checks

**Perform these checks at regular intervals:**

| When | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Start of session** | Read AI.md completely, identify applicable sections |
| **Before each task** | Re-read relevant PART(s) of the spec |
| **Every 3-5 changes** | Stop and verify against spec - are you drifting? |
| **Before completing task** | Full compliance check against relevant sections |
| **If uncertain** | STOP and re-read spec, or ASK user |

## What "NON-NEGOTIABLE" Means

**NON-NEGOTIABLE sections MUST be implemented EXACTLY as specified.**

| Allowed | NOT Allowed |
|---------|-------------|
| Copy spec exactly | "Improve" or "optimize" the spec |
| Ask for clarification | Assume you know better |
| Report conflicts | Silently deviate |
| Request exceptions | Make exceptions yourself |

**If you think a NON-NEGOTIABLE section is wrong:**
1. STOP implementation
2. Tell the user specifically what you think is wrong
3. Ask for explicit permission to deviate
4. Document the deviation in AI.md if approved

## Template File Rules

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **NEVER modify template** | Template file is read-only (location varies) |
| **Identify by content** | Has unreplaced `{variables}`, "HOW TO USE" section |
| **AI.md is project spec** | Copy template → AI.md, customize for project |
| **Keep AI.md current** | Update when template changes or project changes |
| **Delete old files** | Merge CLAUDE.md/SPEC.md (in project) → AI.md |

## Before Starting ANY Work

1. **Locate AI.md** - this is the project specification
2. **If AI.md missing** - create from template, replace variables
3. **Read AI.md COMPLETELY** - not just relevant parts
4. **Identify applicable sections** - which PARTs apply to this task?
5. **Check TODO.AI.md** - see pending tasks
6. **Verify understanding** - if ANYTHING is unclear, ASK

## During Work

1. **Re-read spec before each implementation** - EVERY time
2. **Follow spec EXACTLY** - no "improvements" without asking
3. **Check yourself frequently** - am I drifting from spec?
4. **Update TODO.AI.md** as tasks complete
5. **If stuck or uncertain** - re-read spec or ASK, never guess

## Common Drift Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Correct Approach |
|---------|------------------|
| "I'll use a better pattern" | Use the pattern in the spec |
| "This format makes more sense" | Use the format in the spec |
| "I remember the spec says..." | Re-read the spec, don't rely on memory |
| "This is obviously what they want" | Check the spec, ask if not covered |
| "I'll add this helpful feature" | Only implement what's requested |
| "The spec is outdated here" | Ask before deviating |

## Quick Reference

| File | Location | Purpose | Modify? |
|------|----------|---------|---------|
| Template | Varies (see below) | Master spec | **NEVER** |
| AI.md | Project repo | Project spec | Yes |
| TODO.AI.md | Project repo | Task tracking | Yes |
| README.md | Project repo | User docs | Yes |

# PART 1: CORE RULES (READ FIRST - NON-NEGOTIABLE)

## Working Roles

When working on this project, the following roles are assumed based on the task:

- **Senior Go Developer** - Writing production-quality Go code, making architectural decisions, following best practices, optimizing performance
- **UI/UX Designer** - Creating professional, functional, visually appealing interfaces with excellent user experience
- **Beta Tester** - Testing applications, finding bugs, edge cases, and issues before they reach users
- **User** - Thinking from the end-user perspective, ensuring things are intuitive and work as expected

These are not roleplay - they ARE these roles when the work requires it. Each project gets the full expertise of all four perspectives.

---

## CRITICAL: Specification Compliance

**STOP AND READ THIS SECTION COMPLETELY BEFORE PROCEEDING.**

### The Golden Rules

1. **Re-read this spec periodically** during work to ensure accuracy and no deviation
2. **When in doubt, check the spec** - the spec is the source of truth
3. **Never assume or guess** - ask questions if unclear
4. **Every NON-NEGOTIABLE section MUST be implemented exactly as specified**
5. **Keep AI.md in sync with the project** - always update after changes

### Required Documentation Files

| File | Location | Purpose | Modify? |
|------|----------|---------|---------|
| **Template file** | Varies (anywhere) | Master specification | **NEVER** |
| **AI.md** | Project repository | Project-specific specification | **YES** |
| **TODO.AI.md** | Project repository | Task tracking (>2 tasks) | **YES** |

**Note:** Template file may be named `TEMPLATE.md`, `SPEC.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or other. Location varies (project root, org root, ~/, etc.). Identify by content: unreplaced `{variables}`, "HOW TO USE" section, multiple PART X: sections.

### Documentation Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Template is READ-ONLY** | Never modify - it is the master specification |
| **AI.md is the project spec** | Copy from template, customize for project |
| **Keep AI.md current** | Update when template or project changes |
| **Migrate old files** | Old spec files in project repo → merge into `AI.md`, DELETE |
| **TODO.AI.md for >2 tasks** | Required when doing more than 2 tasks |

**File Hierarchy:**
```
Template File (master, read-only, organization-level)
    └── AI.md (project-specific, each repository)
            └── TODO.AI.md (task tracking, each repository)
```

### README.md (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

## Variables (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `zipcodes` | Project name | `jokes` |
| `apimgr` | Organization name | `apimgr` |
| `{gitprovider}` | Git hosting provider | `github`, `gitlab`, `private` |
| **Rule** | Anything in `{}` is a variable | |
| **Rule** | Anything NOT in `{}` is literal | `/etc/letsencrypt/live` is a real path |

## Local Project Path Structure (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Format:** `~/Projects/{gitprovider}/apimgr/zipcodes`

| Component | Description | Examples |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `~/Projects/` | Base projects directory | Always `~/Projects/` |
| `{gitprovider}` | Git hosting provider or `local` | `github`, `gitlab`, `bitbucket`, `private`, `local` |
| `apimgr` | Organization/username | `apimgr`, `casjay`, `myorg` |
| `zipcodes` | Project name | `jokes`, `icons`, `myproject` |

**Examples:**
```
~/Projects/github/apimgr/jokes        # GitHub, apimgr org, jokes project
~/Projects/gitlab/casjay/icons        # GitLab, casjay user, icons project
~/Projects/private/myorg/myproject    # Private/self-hosted git, myorg, myproject
~/Projects/bitbucket/company/app      # Bitbucket, company org, app project
~/Projects/local/apimgr/prototype     # Local only, no VCS, prototyping
```

### Special: `local` Provider

`~/Projects/local/apimgr/zipcodes` is used for:
- **Prototyping** - Quick experiments and proof-of-concept
- **Bootstrapping** - Initial project setup before pushing to VCS
- **Local-only development** - Projects not intended for remote hosting
- **No VCS required** - May not have git initialized
- **No Docker registry** - May not push to container registries

**This is the LOCAL development path, not the deployed path.**

---

## Directory Structure (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**The root Project directory is**: `./`

```
./                          # Root project directory
├── .github/                # GitHub Actions (if using GitHub)

├── LICENSE.md              # MIT + embedded licenses
├── AI.md                   # Project specification (from TEMPLATE.md)
├── TODO.AI.md              # Task tracking for >2 tasks
├── Jenkinsfile             # Jenkins pipeline
└── release.txt             # Version tracking
```

**Gitignored directories:**
- `binaries/` - All build output (host + all platforms)
- `releases/` - Release output
- `rootfs/` - Runtime volume data

### .gitignore (REQUIRED)

```gitignore
# Build output
binaries/
releases/

# Runtime volume data (NEVER commit)
rootfs/

# IDE
.idea/
.vscode/
*.swp
*.swo

# OS
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
```

### .dockerignore (REQUIRED)

```dockerignore
# Git
.git/
.gitignore

# GitHub/Gitea workflows
.github/
.gitea/

# Entire docker directory
docker/

# Runtime volume data (NEVER include in image)
rootfs/

# Build output
binaries/
releases/

# IDE
.idea/
.vscode/

# Docs
*.md
```

**Note:** `./docker/` is ignored but `COPY docker/rootfs/ /` still works because we build using host docker - files are copied from host filesystem during build, not from build context.

**RULE: Keep the base directory organized and clean - no clutter!**

## Path Convention (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**ALL paths are ALWAYS relative to PROJECT ROOT, never the current working directory.**

| Path | Means | NOT |
|------|-------|-----|
| `./docker/` | `{project_root}/docker/` | `{cwd}/docker/` |
| `./binaries/` | `{project_root}/binaries/` | `{cwd}/binaries/` |
| `./src/` | `{project_root}/src/` | `{cwd}/src/` |

**Rules:**
- Commands MUST be run from project root, OR
- Commands MUST use absolute paths, OR
- Commands MUST `cd` to project root first
- NEVER assume current directory is project root
- Scripts should determine project root programmatically

```bash
# Determine project root (in scripts)
PROJECT_ROOT="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/.." && pwd)"

# Or for Go binaries, use os.Executable()
```

```go
// Determine project root in Go
func getProjectRoot() string {
    exe, _ := os.Executable()
    return filepath.Dir(exe)
}
```

**Example - WRONG vs RIGHT:**
```bash
# WRONG: Assumes cwd is project root
cd binaries && docker build -f ../docker/Dockerfile .

# RIGHT: Explicit project root
docker build -f ./docker/Dockerfile -t myapp ./

# RIGHT: cd to project root first
cd /path/to/project && docker build -f ./docker/Dockerfile .
```

## Runtime Directory Usage (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Be smart about which directory to use for what purpose.**

| Directory | Purpose | Examples |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| `{config_dir}` | User-editable configuration | `server.yml`, email templates, custom themes, SSL certs |
| `{data_dir}` | Application-managed data | databases, Tor keys, caches, GeoIP databases |
| `{log_dir}` | Log files | `access.log`, `error.log`, `audit.log` |
| `{backup_dir}` | Backup files | `.tar.gz` backup archives |

**Rules:**
- If a user might edit it → `{config_dir}`
- If the application manages it → `{data_dir}`
- If it's a log → `{log_dir}`
- If it's a backup → `{backup_dir}`
- **NEVER mix purposes** - don't put user config in data_dir or vice versa

---

## Platform Support (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Operating Systems

| OS | Required |
|----|----------|
| Linux | YES |
| BSD (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc.) | YES |
| macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon) | YES |
| Windows | YES |

### Architectures

| Architecture | Required |
|--------------|----------|
| AMD64 | YES |
| ARM64 | YES |

**IMPORTANT: Be smart about implementations - code must work on ALL platforms.**

---

## Go Version (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Always Latest Stable** | Use latest stable Go version |
| **Build Only** | Go is only for building, not runtime (single static binary) |
| **go.mod** | Always use latest stable version |
| **Docker** | Use `golang:alpine` for build/test/debug |
| **No Pinning** | Don't pin to minor versions unless compatibility issue |

## Required Go Libraries (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**All libraries MUST be pure Go and work with `CGO_ENABLED=0`.**

| Purpose | Library | Why |
|---------|---------|-----|
| **SQLite** | `modernc.org/sqlite` | Pure Go, no CGO required |
| **Tor** | `github.com/cretz/bine` | Pure Go Tor controller |
| **UUID** | `github.com/google/uuid` | Standard UUID generation |

### SQLite Driver (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**MUST use `modernc.org/sqlite`. NEVER use `github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3`.**

| Driver | CGO Required | Use |
|--------|--------------|-----|
| `modernc.org/sqlite` | NO | **ALWAYS USE THIS** |
| `github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3` | YES | **NEVER USE** |

**Why `modernc.org/sqlite`?**
- Pure Go implementation - no C compiler needed
- Works with `CGO_ENABLED=0` for static binaries
- Cross-compilation works without toolchain setup
- Same SQLite functionality, just pure Go

**Usage:**
```go
import (
    "database/sql"
    _ "modernc.org/sqlite"
)

func openDB(path string) (*sql.DB, error) {
    // Driver name is "sqlite" (not "sqlite3")
    return sql.Open("sqlite", path)
}
```

**go.mod:**
```
require modernc.org/sqlite v1.29.1
```

### Forbidden Libraries

| Library | Reason | Alternative |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| `github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3` | Requires CGO | `modernc.org/sqlite` |
| `github.com/ooni/go-libtor` | Requires CGO | `github.com/cretz/bine` + external Tor |
| Any CGO library | Breaks static builds | Find pure Go alternative |

## Password Hashing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**ALL passwords MUST be hashed using Argon2id. NEVER store plaintext passwords.**

### Algorithm Requirements

| Setting | Value | Reason |
|---------|-------|--------|
| **Algorithm** | Argon2id | Winner of Password Hashing Competition, memory-hard |
| **Library** | `golang.org/x/crypto/argon2` | Pure Go, CGO_ENABLED=0 compatible |
| **Fallback** | Bcrypt (cost 12+) | For legacy password verification only |

### Argon2id Parameters (OWASP 2023)

```go
import "golang.org/x/crypto/argon2"

// Recommended parameters
const (
    ArgonTime    = 3         // iterations
    ArgonMemory  = 64 * 1024 // 64 MB
    ArgonThreads = 4         // parallelism
    ArgonKeyLen  = 32        // output length in bytes
    ArgonSaltLen = 16        // salt length in bytes
)

func HashPassword(password string) (string, error) {
    // Generate random salt
    salt := make([]byte, ArgonSaltLen)
    if _, err := rand.Read(salt); err != nil {
        return "", err
    }

    // Hash password
    hash := argon2.IDKey([]byte(password), salt, ArgonTime, ArgonMemory, ArgonThreads, ArgonKeyLen)

    // Encode as string: $argon2id$v=19$m=65536,t=3,p=4$<salt>$<hash>
    return encodeArgon2Hash(salt, hash), nil
}
```

### Storage Format

Passwords stored in PHC string format:
```
$argon2id$v=19$m=65536,t=3,p=4$<base64-salt>$<base64-hash>
```

### Password Rules

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **NEVER** | Store plaintext passwords anywhere |
| **NEVER** | Store passwords in config files (server.yml) |
| **NEVER** | Log passwords (even hashed) |
| **ALWAYS** | Use Argon2id for new passwords |
| **ALWAYS** | Store in database only |
| **ALWAYS** | Generate secure random salt per password |

### API Token Hashing

API tokens are also sensitive and MUST be hashed:

| Token Type | Storage | Hashing |
|------------|---------|---------|
| **API Token** | Database | SHA-256 hash (fast lookup needed) |
| **Session Token** | Database | SHA-256 hash |
| **Password** | Database | Argon2id (slow by design) |

```go
import "crypto/sha256"

func HashToken(token string) string {
    hash := sha256.Sum256([]byte(token))
    return hex.EncodeToString(hash[:])
}
```

**Note:** API tokens use SHA-256 (not Argon2id) because:
- Tokens are already high-entropy random strings
- Need fast lookup for every API request
- Argon2id's slowness is for weak human passwords

# PART 4: PRIVILEGE ESCALATION & USER CREATION (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

## Overview

Application user creation **REQUIRES** privilege escalation. If the user cannot escalate privileges, the application runs as the current user with user-level directories.

## Escalation Detection by OS

### Linux
```
Escalation Methods (in order):
1. Already root (EUID == 0)
2. sudo (if user is in sudoers/wheel group)
3. su (if user knows root password)
4. pkexec (PolicyKit, if available)
5. doas (OpenBSD-style, if configured)
```

### macOS
```
Escalation Methods (in order):
1. Already root (EUID == 0)
2. sudo (user must be in admin group)
3. osascript with administrator privileges (GUI prompt)
```

### BSD
```
Escalation Methods (in order):
1. Already root (EUID == 0)
2. doas (OpenBSD default, others if configured)
3. sudo (if installed and configured)
4. su (if user knows root password)
```

### Windows
```
Escalation Methods (in order):
1. Already Administrator (elevated token)
2. UAC prompt (requires GUI)
3. runas (command line, requires admin password)
```

## User Creation Logic

```
ON --service --install:

1. Check if can escalate privileges
   ├─ YES: Continue with privileged installation
   │   ├─ Create system user/group (UID/GID 100-999)
   │   ├─ Use system directories (/etc, /var/lib, /var/log)
   │   ├─ Install service (systemd/launchd/rc.d/Windows Service)
   │   └─ Set ownership to created user
   │
   └─ NO: Fall back to user installation
       ├─ Skip user creation (run as current user)
       ├─ Use user directories (~/.config, ~/.local/share)
       ├─ Skip system service installation
       └─ Offer alternative (cron, user systemd, launchctl user agent)
```

## System User Requirements (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

| Requirement | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| Username | `zipcodes` |
| Group | `zipcodes` |
| UID/GID | **Must match** - same value for both UID and GID |
| UID/GID Range | 100-999 (system user range) |
| Shell | `/sbin/nologin` or `/usr/sbin/nologin` |
| Home | Config directory (`/etc/apimgr/zipcodes`) or data directory (`/var/lib/apimgr/zipcodes`) |
| Type | System user (no password, no login) |
| Gecos | `zipcodes service account` |

### UID/GID Selection Logic

**The UID and GID MUST be the same value.** Find an unused ID where both UID and GID are available:

```
1. Start at 999 (top of system range)
2. Check if UID is unused (not in /etc/passwd)
3. Check if GID is unused (not in /etc/group)
4. If both available → use this value for both UID and GID
5. If either taken → decrement and repeat
6. Stop at 100 (bottom of system range)
7. If no ID found → error (system has no available IDs)
```

### Go Implementation

```go
func findAvailableSystemID() (int, error) {
    // Start from top of system range, work down
    for id := 999; id >= 100; id-- {
        // Check if UID is available
        if _, err := user.LookupId(strconv.Itoa(id)); err == nil {
            continue
            // UID exists, try next
        }

        // Check if GID is available
        if _, err := user.LookupGroupId(strconv.Itoa(id)); err == nil {
            continue
            // GID exists, try next
        }

        // Both available
        return id, nil
    }
    return 0, fmt.Errorf("no available UID/GID in system range 100-999")
}
```

### Platform-Specific Commands

**Linux:**
```bash
# Create group with specific GID
groupadd --system --gid {id} zipcodes

# Create user with matching UID, same primary group
useradd --system --uid {id} --gid {id} \
  --home-dir /etc/apimgr/zipcodes \
  --shell /sbin/nologin \
  --comment "zipcodes service account" \
  zipcodes
```

### macOS Service Account (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**macOS services (launchd) MUST NOT run as logged-in user or root.**

| Option | Security | Recommendation |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| root | HIGH privileges - dangerous | NO |
| Logged-in User | User privileges - insecure | NO |
| `_www` | Web server account | NO (wrong purpose) |
| **Dedicated service user** | Minimal privileges, isolated | **RECOMMENDED** |

**Default: Dedicated system user with matching UID/GID**

macOS uses `dscl` (Directory Service Command Line) to create system users. The user is hidden from login screen and has no shell access.

**macOS UID/GID Ranges:**

| Range | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| 0-99 | System accounts (reserved) |
| 100-499 | System services (use this range) |
| 500+ | Regular users |

**Create Service Account:**
```bash
# Find available ID in 100-499 range (same logic as Linux but different range)
# Start at 499, work down until both UID and GID are available

# Create group with specific GID
dscl . -create /Groups/zipcodes
dscl . -create /Groups/zipcodes PrimaryGroupID {id}
dscl . -create /Groups/zipcodes Password "*"

# Create user with matching UID
dscl . -create /Users/zipcodes
dscl . -create /Users/zipcodes UniqueID {id}
dscl . -create /Users/zipcodes PrimaryGroupID {id}
dscl . -create /Users/zipcodes UserShell /usr/bin/false
dscl . -create /Users/zipcodes RealName "zipcodes service account"
dscl . -create /Users/zipcodes NFSHomeDirectory /usr/local/var/apimgr/zipcodes
dscl . -create /Users/zipcodes Password "*"

# Hide user from login window
dscl . -create /Users/zipcodes IsHidden 1
```

**launchd plist with UserName:**
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">

**macOS Directory Structure:**

| Directory | Path | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Binary | `/usr/local/bin/zipcodes` | Executable |
| Config | `/usr/local/etc/apimgr/zipcodes/` | Configuration files |
| Data | `/usr/local/var/apimgr/zipcodes/` | Application data |
| Logs | `/usr/local/var/log/apimgr/zipcodes/` | Log files |
| launchd plist | `/Library/LaunchDaemons/apimgr.zipcodes.plist` | Service definition |

**Go Implementation (macOS):**
```go
// +build darwin

func findAvailableMacOSSystemID() (int, error) {
    // macOS system services use 100-499 range
    for id := 499; id >= 100; id-- {
        // Check if UID is available
        if _, err := user.LookupId(strconv.Itoa(id)); err == nil {
            continue
        }

        // Check if GID is available

            return fmt.Errorf("failed to run %v: %w", cmd, err)
        }
    }
    return nil
}
```

  -d /var/lib/apimgr/zipcodes \
  -s /usr/sbin/nologin \
  -c "zipcodes service account"
```

### Windows Service Account (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Windows services MUST NOT run as logged-in user or Administrator.**

| Option | Security | Recommendation |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| Local System | HIGH privileges - dangerous | NO |
| Administrator | HIGH privileges - dangerous | NO |
| Logged-in User | User privileges - insecure | NO |
| Local Service | Limited privileges | OK for network-less services |
| Network Service | Limited + network access | OK for network services |
| **Virtual Service Account** | Minimal privileges, isolated | **RECOMMENDED** |
| Managed Service Account | Domain-managed, auto-password | Enterprise environments |

**Default: Virtual Service Account (VSA)**

Virtual Service Accounts are automatically managed by Windows, require no password management, and have minimal privileges. They are created automatically when the service is installed.

**Service Account Format:** `NT SERVICE\zipcodes`

```powershell
# Create service with Virtual Service Account (automatic)
New-Service -Name "zipcodes" `
  -BinaryPathName "C:\Program Files\apimgr\zipcodes\zipcodes.exe" `
  -DisplayName "zipcodes" `
  -Description "zipcodes service" `
  -StartupType Automatic

# Service automatically runs as NT SERVICE\zipcodes
# No user creation needed - Windows manages it
```

**Directory Permissions:**
```powershell
# Grant Virtual Service Account access to config/data directories
$acl = Get-Acl "C:\ProgramData\apimgr\zipcodes"
$rule = New-Object System.Security.AccessControl.FileSystemAccessRule(
    "NT SERVICE\zipcodes",
    "FullControl",
    "ContainerInherit,ObjectInherit",
    "None",
    "Allow"
)
$acl.SetAccessRule($rule)
Set-Acl "C:\ProgramData\apimgr\zipcodes" $acl
```

**Go Implementation (Windows):**
```go
// +build windows

import "golang.org/x/sys/windows/svc/mgr"

func installWindowsService() error {
    m, err := mgr.Connect()
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    defer m.Disconnect()

    exePath, _ := os.Executable()

    // Create service - runs as Virtual Service Account by default
    // when ServiceStartName is empty or "NT SERVICE\{name}"
    s, err := m.CreateService(
        "zipcodes",
        exePath,
        mgr.Config{
            DisplayName:     "zipcodes",
            Description:     "zipcodes service",
            StartType:       mgr.StartAutomatic,
            ServiceStartName: "", // Empty = Virtual Service Account
        },
    )
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    defer s.Close()

    return nil
}
```

**Windows Directory Structure:**

| Directory | Path | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Binary | `C:\Program Files\apimgr\zipcodes\` | Executable |
| Config | `C:\ProgramData\apimgr\zipcodes\config\` | Configuration files |
| Data | `C:\ProgramData\apimgr\zipcodes\data\` | Application data |
| Logs | `C:\ProgramData\apimgr\zipcodes\logs\` | Log files |

### Home Directory Selection

| Directory | Use When |
|-----------|----------|
| Config dir (`/etc/apimgr/zipcodes`) | Default - user needs access to config files |
| Data dir (`/var/lib/apimgr/zipcodes`) | When data dir contains user-writable content |

**Note:** Home directory must exist before user creation. Create directories first, then user, then set ownership.

# PART 5: SERVICE SUPPORT (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

## Built-in Service Support

**ALL projects MUST have built-in service support for ALL service managers:**

| Service Manager | OS |
|-----------------|-----|
| systemd | Linux |
| runit | Linux |
| Windows Service Manager | Windows |
| launchd | macOS |
| rc.d | BSD |

---

# PART 6: CONFIGURATION (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

## Configuration Storage

**Configuration can be stored in `server.yml` OR database, depending on mode.**

### Terminology

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **server.yml** | YAML configuration file on disk |
| **Configuration** | Settings (stored in server.yml OR database) |
| **Database** | SQLite (local) or PostgreSQL/MySQL (remote) |
| **Server Address** | The bind address for the server (e.g., `[::]`, `0.0.0.0`, `127.0.0.1`) |
| **FQDN** | Fully Qualified Domain Name (e.g., `api.example.com`) |
| **Node ID** | Unique identifier for a cluster node (default: hostname) |

**IMPORTANT:** We use "Server Address" (bind address), NOT "Server Name". The server address is where the server listens; the FQDN is how clients reach it.

### Configuration Source of Truth

| Mode | Source of Truth | server.yml Role |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Single Instance (SQLite)** | server.yml | Primary configuration |
| **Cluster Mode (Remote DB)** | Database | Bootstrap only (connection settings) |

### Single Instance Mode

```
server.yml (source of truth)
     │
     ▼
Application reads config
     │
     ▼
Admin panel writes to server.yml
```

- All settings stored in `server.yml`
- Admin panel edits `server.yml` directly
- SQLite databases for credentials/sessions only

### Cluster Mode

```
server.yml (cache + backup)
     │
     └─ Contains: database connection + cached config

Database (source of truth)
     │
     ▼
Application reads config from DB
     │
     ▼
Admin panel writes to database
     │
     ▼
Changes synced to server.yml cache
     │
     ▼
All nodes see changes immediately
```

- Database is source of truth
- `server.yml` is cache AND backup
- Admin panel writes to database
- Changes automatically synced to local `server.yml`
- If database unavailable → read-only mode using cached config

### server.yml as Cache/Backup (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**When using external database, server.yml becomes a local cache and backup.**

                         uses cached config
```

### Config Sync (Database → server.yml)

**Every config change in database is synced to local server.yml:**

```go
func onConfigChange(db *sql.DB, key string, value interface{}) {
    // 1. Write to database (source of truth)
    writeToDatabase(db, key, value)

    // 2. Sync to local server.yml (cache)
    syncToLocalConfig(key, value)

    // 3. Update last_sync timestamp
    updateSyncTimestamp()
}
```

**Sync happens:**
- Immediately after any config change
- On application startup (DB → server.yml)
- Periodically (every 5 minutes) to catch any drift

### Maintenance Mode (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Only TWO types of errors are truly critical:**
1. Database connection error
2. Cannot write to files (disk full, permissions, etc.)

**All other errors are recoverable. The system ALWAYS attempts self-healing.**

### Critical Error Detection

| Error Type | Detection | Self-Healing Attempt |
|------------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Database connection** | Connection refused, timeout, auth failed | Retry with backoff, check credentials |
| **Database write** | Write failed, transaction error | Retry, check permissions, check disk |
| **File read** | Permission denied, file not found | Check permissions, recreate if possible |
| **File write** | Permission denied, disk full | Check permissions, check disk space, cleanup |

### Mode States

| State | Condition | Behavior |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Normal** | All systems healthy | Full functionality |
| **Maintenance** | Critical error detected | Read-only + admin guidance |
| **Starting** | Application starting up | Checking systems |

### Maintenance Mode

**When a critical error occurs, the application enters maintenance mode:**

| Aspect | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Public API** | Read-only operations only |
| **Admin panel** | Accessible with fix instructions |
| **Writes** | Rejected with 503 |
| **Self-healing** | Continuously attempting in background |
| **Recovery** | Automatic when issue resolved |

#### Error-Specific Guidance

**Database Connection Failed:**

| Check | Command/Action | What to Look For |
|-------|----------------|------------------|
| Server running | `systemctl status postgresql` | Active (running) |
| Network | `ping db.example.com` | Response |
| Port open | `telnet db.example.com 5432` | Connected |
| Credentials | Check server.yml | Correct password |
| Max connections | Check DB logs | "too many connections" |
| Firewall | Check iptables/ufw | Port 5432 allowed |

**Disk Full:**

| Check | Command/Action | What to Look For |
|-------|----------------|------------------|
| Disk space | `df -h` | Usage % |
| Large files | `du -sh /var/log/*` | Oversized logs |
| Old backups | Check backup directory | Old files to delete |
| Temp files | Check /tmp | Cleanup candidates |

**Auto-cleaned:**
- Logs older than retention policy
- Temp files older than 24 hours
- Old backup files (keeps last 5)

**Permission Denied:**

| Check | Command/Action | What to Look For |
|-------|----------------|------------------|
| Directory owner | `ls -la /path/to/dir` | Correct user:group |
| Directory perms | `stat /path/to/dir` | Write permission |
| SELinux/AppArmor | `getenforce` / `aa-status` | Blocking access |
| Disk mounted | `mount` | Read-only mount |

### API Responses in Maintenance Mode

**All write operations return:**

```json
{
  "error": "Service in maintenance mode",
  "code": "MAINTENANCE_MODE",
  "status": 503,
  "message": "System is in maintenance mode due to: Database connection failed",
  "reason": "database_connection",
  "self_healing": true,
  "retry_after": 30
}
```

**Headers:**
```
Retry-After: 30
X-Maintenance-Mode: true
X-Maintenance-Reason: database_connection
```

### /healthz in Maintenance Mode

```json
{
  "status": "maintenance",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "mode": "maintenance",
  "uptime": "2d 5h 30m",
  "maintenance": {
    "reason": "database_connection",
    "message": "Database connection failed",
    "since": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "self_healing": {
      "enabled": true,
      "attempts": 15,
      "last_attempt": "2025-01-15T10:35:00Z",
      "next_attempt": "2025-01-15T10:35:30Z"
    }
  },
  "checks": {
    "database": "error",
    "disk": "ok",
    "config": "ok"
  }
}
```

### Recovery (Automatic)

**When self-healing succeeds:**

```
1. Self-healing attempt succeeds
         │
         ▼
2. Verify system is stable
   - Run health checks
   - Verify read/write works
         │
         ▼
3. Log: "Issue resolved, exiting maintenance mode"
         │
         ▼
4. Exit maintenance mode
   - Set mode = normal
   - Remove maintenance banner
   - Re-enable write operations
         │
         ▼
5. Send notification (if email configured)
   - "System recovered from maintenance mode"
   - Include duration and cause
         │
         ▼
6. Resume normal operation
```

### Maintenance Mode Config

```yaml
server:
  maintenance:
    # Self-healing settings
    self_healing:
      enabled: true
      retry_interval: 30
      # seconds between retry attempts
      max_attempts: 0
      # 0 = unlimited (keep trying forever)

    # Auto-cleanup thresholds
    cleanup:
      disk_threshold: 90
      # Start cleanup when disk > 90% full
      log_retention_days: 7
      # Delete logs older than 7 days during cleanup
      backup_keep_count: 5
      # Keep last 5 backups during cleanup

    # Notifications
    notify:
      on_enter: true
      # Notify when entering maintenance mode
      on_exit: true
      # Notify when exiting maintenance mode
```

**Server Tables (server_* prefix):**

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `server_admin_credentials` | Admin username/password/token |
| `server_admin_sessions` | Admin web sessions |
| `server_config` | All configuration key-value pairs |

## Boolean Handling (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Accept ALL of these values for booleans:**

| Truthy | Falsy |
|--------|-------|
| `1` | `0` |
| `yes` | `no` |
| `true` | `false` |
| `enable` | `disable` |

## Environment Variables (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Runtime Variables (Always Checked)

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `DOMAIN` | FQDN override (highest priority for hostname resolution) |
| `MODE` | `production` (default) or `development` |
| `DATABASE_DRIVER` | `file`, `sqlite`, `mariadb`, `mysql`, `postgres`, `mssql`, `mongodb` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Database connection string |

**FQDN Resolution Order:** `Reverse Proxy Headers` → `DOMAIN` → `os.Hostname()` → `$HOSTNAME` → Global IPv6 → Global IPv4 → `localhost`

**Note:** Loopback addresses (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `::1`) are avoided; global IPs preferred.

### Init-Only Variables (First Run Only)

**Init-only variables are used ONCE during first run, then ignored.**

---

## Configuration File (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Design Rules

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Clean & Intuitive** | Easy to read and understand |
| **Everything Configurable** | If it has a setting, it's in the config |
| **Sane Defaults** | Built-in defaults (no 1000-line configs) |
| **Comprehensive** | All options present (commented/defaulted) |
| **Comments** | Single-line, under 140 characters |

### Location

| User Type | Path |
|-----------|------|
| Root | `/etc/apimgr/zipcodes/server.yml` |
| Regular | `~/.config/apimgr/zipcodes/server.yml` |

### Migration

**If `server.yaml` found, auto-migrate to `server.yml` on startup.**

## Port Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Default port is a random unused port in the 64000-64999 range.**

### Port Selection Logic

| Scenario | Port | Behavior |
|----------|------|----------|
| First run (no config) | Random 64xxx | Auto-select unused port in 64000-64999, **save to config** |
| Config specifies port | Use specified | Use exact port from config |
| Port in use | Error | Fail with clear error message |
| Privileged port (<1024) | Requires root | Warn if not running as root |

**IMPORTANT: Once a port is selected (randomly or specified), it is saved to `server.yml` and persists across restarts. The random selection only happens on first run when no port is configured.**

### Why Random 64xxx?

| Reason | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Avoid conflicts** | Most services use well-known ports; 64xxx is rarely used |
| **No root required** | Ports >1024 don't need root privileges |
| **Self-hosted friendly** | Users can run multiple instances without conflict |
| **Reverse proxy ready** | Designed to run behind nginx/caddy/traefik |

### Special Port Handling

| Port | Special Behavior |
|------|------------------|
| `80` | Enable Let's Encrypt HTTP-01 challenge |
| `443` | Enable Let's Encrypt TLS-ALPN-01 challenge, auto-enable SSL |
| `0` | Let OS assign any available port |
| `64000-64999` | Default range for random selection |

### Port Display Rules

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Strip `:80` | Don't show port for HTTP on 80 |
| Strip `:443` | Don't show port for HTTPS on 443 |
| Always show others | Show port for all non-standard ports |

### Dual Port Support

**Applications can listen on two ports simultaneously for HTTP and HTTPS:**

| Format | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Single | One port (HTTP; exception: port 443 = HTTPS-only; `ssl.enabled` overrides) | `8090` |
| Dual | HTTP port, HTTPS port (comma-separated) | `8090,8443` |

**Dual Port Behavior:**

| HTTP Port | HTTPS Port | Behavior |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| Any | Any | Both ports active, HTTP redirects to HTTPS optional |
| 80 | 443 | Let's Encrypt challenges enabled, standard web ports |
| 64xxx | 64xxx+1 | Common pattern for random ports |

```yaml
# Single port (HTTP by default; exception: port 443 = HTTPS-only mode; ssl.enabled overrides)
server:
  port: 8090

# Single port with ssl.enabled override (HTTPS on non-443 port)
server:
  port: 8090
  ssl:
    enabled: true  # Forces HTTPS on port 8090

# Dual port (HTTP on 8090, HTTPS on 8443)
server:
  port: "8090,8443"
  ssl:
    enabled: true

# Standard web ports
server:
  port: "80,443"
  ssl:
    enabled: true
    letsencrypt:
      enabled: true
```

### Configuration

```yaml
server:
  # Port options:
  # - Omit or empty: Random port in 64000-64999 range
  # - Single number: Use that exact port
  # - Dual (HTTP,HTTPS): "8090,8443" format
  # - 0: Let OS assign any available port
  port: 64580
```

### Admin Panel

Port can be changed via `/admin/server/settings`, but **requires server restart** (with warning shown to user).

### Example Structure

```yaml
# =============================================================================
# SERVER CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================

server:
  port: {random}              # Default: random unused port in 64xxx range
  fqdn: {hostname}            # Auto-detected from host
  address: "[::]"             # [::] = all interfaces IPv4/IPv6
  mode: production            # production or development

# CHECKPOINT 4: CONFIGURATION VERIFICATION

Before proceeding, confirm you understand:
- [ ] Config file is `server.yml` (not .yaml)
- [ ] Boolean handling accepts multiple truthy/falsy values
- [ ] Environment variables: some runtime, some init-only
- [ ] Config auto-created on first run with sane defaults

# PART 8: SSL/TLS & LET'S ENCRYPT (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

## Built-in Let's Encrypt Support

**ALL projects MUST have built-in Let's Encrypt support.**

### Supported Challenge Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| DNS-01 | All providers and RFC2136 |
| TLS-ALPN-01 | TLS-based challenge |
| HTTP-01 | HTTP-based challenge |

### FQDN Resolution (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**The FQDN is determined in this order (first valid, non-loopback wins):**

| Priority | Source | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | **Reverse Proxy Headers** | `X-Forwarded-Host`, `X-Real-Host`, `X-Original-Host` (preferred - we want to be behind a proxy) |
| 2 | `DOMAIN` env var | User override (recommended for production) |
| 3 | `os.Hostname()` | Go's cross-platform hostname function |
| 4 | `$HOSTNAME` env var | Shell environment fallback |
| 5 | Global IPv6 | First routable IPv6 address |
| 6 | Global IPv4 | First routable IPv4 address |

**IMPORTANT: Reverse proxy headers take priority because we prefer apps to run behind a reverse proxy. Avoid loopback addresses (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `::1`) whenever possible.**

**DOMAIN Usage:**

| Environment | DOMAIN Value | Example |
|-------------|--------------|---------|
| **Development** | `zipcodes` | `DOMAIN=jokes` |
| **Production** | Valid FQDN | `DOMAIN=api.example.com` |

**Valid Production DOMAIN formats:**
```
DOMAIN=example.com             # Simple TLD
DOMAIN=google.co.uk            # eTLD+1 with complex suffix
DOMAIN=my.server.domain.co.uk  # Subdomain of eTLD+1
DOMAIN=api.example.com         # Standard subdomain
```

**Do NOT set DOMAIN to overlay network addresses:**
- `.onion`, `.i2p`, `.exit` - these are app-generated and managed
- App handles overlay network registration/generation automatically
- Overlay addresses shown separately in console (see below)

**Go Implementation:**
```go
// GetHostFromRequest - use this for request-time host resolution (preferred)
func GetHostFromRequest(r *http.Request, projectName string) string {
    // 1. Reverse proxy headers (highest priority - we prefer to be behind a proxy)
    for _, header := range []string{"X-Forwarded-Host", "X-Real-Host", "X-Original-Host"} {
        if host := r.Header.Get(header); host != "" {
            // Strip port if present (we handle port separately)
            if h, _, err := net.SplitHostPort(host); err == nil {
                return h
            }
            return host
        }
    }

    // 2. Fall back to static resolution
    return GetFQDN(projectName)
}

// GetFQDN - use this when no request context available (startup, background tasks)
func GetFQDN(projectName string) string {
    // 1. DOMAIN env var (explicit user override)
    if domain := os.Getenv("DOMAIN"); domain != "" {
        return domain
    }

    // 2. os.Hostname() - cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows, BSD)
    if hostname, err := os.Hostname(); err == nil && hostname != "" {
        if !isLoopback(hostname) {
            return hostname
        }
    }

    // 3. $HOSTNAME env var (skip loopback)
    if hostname := os.Getenv("HOSTNAME"); hostname != "" {
        if !isLoopback(hostname) {
            return hostname
        }
    }

    // 4. Global IPv6 (preferred for modern networks)
    if ipv6 := getGlobalIPv6(); ipv6 != "" {
        return ipv6
    }

    // 5. Global IPv4
    if ipv4 := getGlobalIPv4(); ipv4 != "" {
        return ipv4
    }

    // Last resort (not recommended)
    return "localhost"
}

func isLoopback(host string) bool {
    lower := strings.ToLower(host)
    if lower == "localhost" {
        return true
    }
    if ip := net.ParseIP(host); ip != nil {
        return ip.IsLoopback()
    }
    return false
}

func getGlobalIPv6() string {
    addrs, err := net.InterfaceAddrs()
    if err != nil {
        return ""
    }
    for _, addr := range addrs {
        if ipnet, ok := addr.(*net.IPNet); ok {
            if ipnet.IP.To4() == nil && ipnet.IP.IsGlobalUnicast() {
                return ipnet.IP.String()
            }
        }
    }
    return ""
}

func getGlobalIPv4() string {
    addrs, err := net.InterfaceAddrs()
    if err != nil {
        return ""
    }
    for _, addr := range addrs {
        if ipnet, ok := addr.(*net.IPNet); ok {
            if ip4 := ipnet.IP.To4(); ip4 != nil && ipnet.IP.IsGlobalUnicast() {
                return ip4.String()
            }
        }
    }
    return ""
}
```

**Note:** For production SSL/Let's Encrypt, always set `DOMAIN` explicitly:
```bash
export DOMAIN=api.example.com
```

**The resolved FQDN is used for:**
- SSL certificate lookup and generation
- Let's Encrypt certificate requests
- `server.host` default value (if not configured)

### Dev TLD Handling (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Dev TLDs are allowed in development mode but require global IP fallback for remote access.**

**Dynamic Dev TLDs (project name as TLD):**
- `zipcodes` - e.g., `app.jokes`, `my.quotes`, `dev.api`
- `zipcodes.local` - e.g., `app.jokes.local`
- `zipcodes.test` - e.g., `app.jokes.test`

**Static Dev TLDs:**
- `.local`, `.test`, `.example`, `.invalid` (RFC 6761)
- `.localhost`, `.lan`, `.internal`, `.home`, `.localdomain`
- `.home.arpa`, `.intranet`, `.corp`, `.private`

**Get display URL (returns ONE URL):**

```go
// GetDisplayURL returns the best URL for display/access
// Prefers valid FQDN, falls back to global IP if dev TLD
// isHTTPS: true if this is the HTTPS port (second port in dual mode)
func GetDisplayURL(projectName string, port int, isHTTPS bool) string {
    fqdn := GetFQDN(projectName)

    // If valid production FQDN, use it
    if !isDevTLD(fqdn, projectName) && fqdn != "localhost" {
        return formatURL(fqdn, port, isHTTPS)
    }

    // Dev TLD or localhost - use global IP instead
    if ipv6 := getGlobalIPv6(); ipv6 != "" {
        return formatURL("["+ipv6+"]", port, isHTTPS)
    }
    if ipv4 := getGlobalIPv4(); ipv4 != "" {
        return formatURL(ipv4, port, isHTTPS)
    }

    // Last resort
    return formatURL(fqdn, port, isHTTPS)
}

func isDevTLD(host, projectName string) bool {
    lower := strings.ToLower(host)

    // Check dynamic project-specific TLD (e.g., app.jokes, dev.quotes, quotes, jokes, zipcodes)
    if projectName != "" && strings.HasSuffix(lower, "."+strings.ToLower(projectName)) {
        return true
    }

    // Check static dev TLDs
    for tld := range devOnlyTLDs {
        if strings.HasSuffix(lower, "."+tld) || lower == tld {
            return true
        }
    }

    return false
}
```

**Startup Banner - Pretty Console with Icons:**

**IMPORTANT: Logs are ALWAYS raw text. No icons, ASCII art, or special characters in log output.**

| Element | Icon | Usage |
|---------|------|-------|
| App name | 🚀 | Header |
| Version | 📦 | Version info |
| Production mode | 🔒 | Mode indicator |
| Development mode | 🔧 | Mode indicator |
| Tor/Onion | 🧅 | Overlay network |
| I2P | 🔗 | Overlay network |
| SSL/HTTPS | 🔐 | Secure connection |
| HTTP | 🌐 | Non-secure connection |
| IPv6 | 🌍 | Network address |
| IPv4 | 🌐 | Network address |
| Success | ✅ | Status |
| Warning | ⚠️ | Status |
| Error | ❌ | Status |
| Info | ℹ️ | Status |

**Port Configuration (Project-Wide, NON-NEGOTIABLE):**

| Mode | Config | HTTP Port | HTTPS Port |
|------|--------|-----------|------------|
| Single HTTP | `--port 8080` | 8080 | None |
| Single HTTPS | `--port 443` | None | 443 |
| Dual | `--port 80,443` | 80 | 443 |
| Dual | `--port 8080,8443` | 8080 | 8443 |

**Rules:**
- Single port: HTTP by default
- **Exception: If single port is 443 → HTTPS-only mode**
- Dual ports: First = HTTP, Second = HTTPS
- **Override: `CONFIG(ssl.enabled)` can override HTTP → HTTPS on any port**

**URL Format Rule:**

**ALWAYS strip :80 and :443.**

| Port | Protocol | URL |
|------|----------|-----|
| 80 | HTTP | `http://host` |
| 443 | HTTPS | `https://host` |
| Other | Depends on config | `{proto}://host:{port}` |

```go
func formatURL(host string, port int, isHTTPS bool) string {
    proto := "http"
    if isHTTPS || port == 443 {
        proto = "https"
    }

    // Always strip :80 and :443
    if port == 80 || port == 443 {
        return proto + "://" + host
    }

    return fmt.Sprintf("%s://%s:%d", proto, host, port)
}
```

**Usage:**
```go
// Single HTTP port
formatURL(host, 8080, false)  // http://host:8080

// Single HTTPS port (443 = HTTPS-only mode)
formatURL(host, 443, false)   // https://host  (443 forces HTTPS)

// Dual port mode
formatURL(host, 80, false)    // http://host
formatURL(host, 443, true)    // https://host
formatURL(host, 8080, false)  // http://host:8080
formatURL(host, 8443, true)   // https://host:8443
```

**Overlay Network Protocol Rules (Tor, I2P, etc.):**

| Network | Default | HTTPS-Only Mode | Certificate |
|---------|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| Clearnet | HTTP/HTTPS | Port 443 | Let's Encrypt or local |
| Tor (.onion) | HTTP | When clearnet is HTTPS-only | Self-signed (LE doesn't support .onion) |
| I2P (.i2p) | HTTP | When clearnet is HTTPS-only | Self-signed (LE doesn't support .i2p) |

**Rules:**
- Overlay networks inherit HTTPS-only mode from clearnet configuration
- If clearnet port is 443 (HTTPS-only) → overlay also uses HTTPS
- If clearnet is dual port (80,443) → overlay uses HTTP (encryption provided by overlay)
- Overlay HTTPS requires self-signed certificates (Let's Encrypt doesn't support .onion/.i2p)

**Banner Examples:**

| Clearnet Config | Tor URL | I2P URL |
|-----------------|---------|---------|
| `--port 8080` | `http://{onion}.onion` | `http://{i2p}.b32.i2p` |
| `--port 443` | `https://{onion}.onion` | `https://{i2p}.b32.i2p` |
| `--port 80,443` | `http://{onion}.onion` | `http://{i2p}.b32.i2p` |
| `--port 8080,8443` | `http://{onion}.onion` | `http://{i2p}.b32.i2p` |

**Why HTTP for overlays in dual mode?**
- Tor/I2P provide end-to-end encryption at the network layer
- HTTPS adds overhead without additional security benefit
- Only use HTTPS on overlays when HTTPS-only mode is required (port 443)

**Footer timestamp format:** `%a %b %d, %Y at %H:%M:%S %Z` → `Wed Jan 15, 2025 at 09:00:00 EST`

### Console vs Logs (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

| Output | Icons | ASCII Art | Colors | Format |
|--------|-------|-----------|--------|--------|
| **Startup banner** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Pretty |
| **Interactive console** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Pretty |
| **Log files** | ❌ Never | ❌ Never | ❌ Never | Raw text |
| **Log output (stdout)** | ❌ Never | ❌ Never | ❌ Never | Raw text |

**Log format is ALWAYS plain text:**
```
2025-01-15 09:00:00 INFO  Server started on :8080
2025-01-15 09:00:01 INFO  Database connected
2025-01-15 09:00:05 WARN  High memory usage: 85%
2025-01-15 09:00:10 ERROR Connection timeout to upstream
```

**Never this in logs:**
```
✅ Server started    <- NO icons in logs
🔧 Development mode  <- NO icons in logs
```

### Certificate Lookup Order (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**On startup, check for existing certificates in this order:**

| Priority | Path | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| 1 | `/etc/letsencrypt/live/domain/` | Literal "domain" directory (common shared setup) |
| 2 | `/etc/letsencrypt/live/{fqdn}/` | FQDN-named directory (e.g., `/etc/letsencrypt/live/api.example.com/`) |
| 3 | `{config_dir}/ssl/letsencrypt/{fqdn}/` | App-managed Let's Encrypt certificates |
| 4 | `{config_dir}/ssl/local/{fqdn}/` | Self-signed or user-provided certificates |

**Certificate Validation:**
- Certificate CN or SAN must match configured FQDN (`server.host`)
- Certificate must not be expired
- Both cert and key files must be readable

### Certificate Directory Structure

```
{config_dir}/ssl/
├── letsencrypt/
│   └── {fqdn}/                # e.g., api.example.com/
│       ├── fullchain.pem
│       └── privkey.pem
└── local/
    └── {fqdn}/                # e.g., api.example.com/
        ├── cert.pem
        └── key.pem
```

**Mirrors certbot structure** (`/etc/letsencrypt/live/{fqdn}/`) for consistency.

### Certificate Management Ownership

| Location | Manager | Renewal |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `/etc/letsencrypt/live/**` | **System** (certbot) | App does NOT renew |
| `{config_dir}/ssl/letsencrypt/{fqdn}/` | **App** | Auto-renew 7 days before expiry |
| `{config_dir}/ssl/local/{fqdn}/` | **User** | No auto-renewal (manual) |

**Rule: If cert is in `{config_dir}/ssl/**`, app manages. Subdirectory determines HOW.**

### Renewal Rules

| Directory | Check Frequency | Renewal Trigger |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| `{config_dir}/ssl/letsencrypt/{fqdn}/` | Daily (02:00) | 7 days before expiry |
| `{config_dir}/ssl/local/{fqdn}/` | Never | Manual only |
| `/etc/letsencrypt/live/**` | Never | System (certbot) manages |

**Logic Flow:**
```
Startup (for configured FQDN)
   │
   ├─► Check /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain/
   │   └─► Found + cert matches FQDN? → Use it (system manages)
   │
   ├─► Check /etc/letsencrypt/live/{fqdn}/
   │   └─► Found? → Use it (system manages)
   │
   ├─► Check {config_dir}/ssl/letsencrypt/{fqdn}/
   │   └─► Found? → Use it (app auto-renews)
   │
   ├─► Check {config_dir}/ssl/local/{fqdn}/
   │   └─► Found? → Use it (no auto-renewal)
   │
   └─► Not found anywhere
       └─► Request new cert via Let's Encrypt
           └─► Save to {config_dir}/ssl/letsencrypt/{fqdn}/ (app auto-renews)
```

**Important:**
- `/etc/letsencrypt/` → app uses but does NOT manage renewal
- `{config_dir}/ssl/letsencrypt/{fqdn}/` → app manages, auto-renews 7 days before expiry
- `{config_dir}/ssl/local/{fqdn}/` → app uses but does NOT auto-renew (user manages)

# PART 9: SCHEDULER (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

## Built-in Scheduler

**ALL projects MUST have a built-in scheduler that is ALWAYS RUNNING.**

### Core Requirements

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Always Running** | Scheduler starts with application and runs until shutdown |
| **Persistent State** | Task state survives restarts (stored in server.db) |
| **Automatic Recovery** | Missed tasks run on startup if within catch-up window |
| **Cluster Aware** | Only one node runs each task in cluster mode |
| **No External Dependencies** | Built-in, no cron or external scheduler needed |

### Built-in Tasks (Required)

Every project MUST include these scheduled tasks:

| Task | Default Schedule | Purpose | Skippable |
|------|-----------------|---------|-----------|
| `ssl.renewal` | Daily at 02:00 | Renew `{config_dir}/ssl/letsencrypt/{fqdn}/` certs 7 days before expiry | No |
| `geoip.update` | Weekly (Sunday 03:00) | Update GeoIP databases | Yes |
| `blocklist.update` | Daily at 04:00 | Update IP blocklists | Yes |
| `session.cleanup` | Hourly | Remove expired sessions | No |
| `token.cleanup` | Daily at 05:00 | Remove expired tokens | No |
| `backup.auto` | Disabled by default | Automatic backups | Yes |
| `healthcheck.self` | Every 5 minutes | Self-health verification | No |
| `cluster.heartbeat` | Every 30 seconds | Cluster node heartbeat (cluster mode only) | No |

### Task Configuration

```yaml
server:
  scheduler:
    # Scheduler is ALWAYS enabled - cannot be disabled
    # This setting only controls whether custom tasks run
    enabled: true

    # Timezone for scheduled tasks (default: America/New_York)
    timezone: America/New_York

    # Catch-up window: run missed tasks if within this duration
    catch_up_window: 1h

    # Built-in tasks (can adjust schedule, cannot disable critical tasks)
    tasks:
      ssl_renewal:
        schedule: "0 2 * * *"      # Cron format: daily at 02:00
        enabled: true

      geoip_update:
        schedule: "0 3 * * 0"      # Weekly Sunday at 03:00
        enabled: true

      blocklist_update:
        schedule: "0 4 * * *"      # Daily at 04:00
        enabled: true

      session_cleanup:
        schedule: "@hourly"        # Every hour
        enabled: true

      token_cleanup:
        schedule: "0 5 * * *"      # Daily at 05:00
        enabled: true

      backup_auto:
        schedule: "0 1 * * *"      # Daily at 01:00
        enabled: false             # Disabled by default
        keep_count: 5              # Keep last 5 backups

      healthcheck_self:
        schedule: "@every 5m"      # Every 5 minutes
        enabled: true
```

### Schedule Format

| Format | Example | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Cron | `0 2 * * *` | Standard cron (minute hour day month weekday) |
| `@hourly` | `@hourly` | Every hour at minute 0 |
| `@daily` | `@daily` | Every day at 00:00 |
| `@weekly` | `@weekly` | Every Sunday at 00:00 |
| `@monthly` | `@monthly` | First day of month at 00:00 |
| `@every Xm` | `@every 5m` | Every X minutes |
| `@every Xh` | `@every 2h` | Every X hours |

### Scheduler State (Persistent)

Task state is stored in `server.db`:

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `task_id` | String | Unique task identifier |
| `task_name` | String | Human-readable name |
| `schedule` | String | Cron/interval expression |
| `last_run` | Timestamp | When task last completed |
| `last_status` | String | success, failed, skipped |
| `last_error` | String | Error message if failed |
| `next_run` | Timestamp | Scheduled next execution |
| `run_count` | Integer | Total successful runs |
| `fail_count` | Integer | Total failed runs |
| `enabled` | Boolean | Is task enabled |
| `locked_by` | String | Node ID holding lock (cluster mode) |
| `locked_at` | Timestamp | When lock was acquired |

### Startup Behavior

```
Application Start
       │
       ▼
Load scheduler state from database
       │
       ▼
Check for missed tasks (within catch_up_window)
       │
       ├─► Found missed tasks
       │   │
       │   ▼
       │   Queue missed tasks for immediate execution
       │   (in order of original scheduled time)
       │
       ▼
Start scheduler loop
       │
       ▼
Scheduler runs continuously until shutdown
```

### Cluster Mode Task Distribution

In cluster mode, tasks are distributed to prevent duplicate execution:

| Task Type | Execution |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Global Tasks** | Run on ONE node only (leader election) |
| **Local Tasks** | Run on EVERY node |

**Global Tasks (run once per cluster):**
- `ssl.renewal`
- `geoip.update`
- `blocklist.update`
- `backup.auto`

**Local Tasks (run on each node):**
- `session.cleanup`
- `token.cleanup`
- `healthcheck.self`
- `cluster.heartbeat`

### Task Locking (Cluster Mode)

```
Task Ready to Run
       │
       ▼
Attempt to acquire lock in database
       │
       ├─► Lock acquired
       │   │
       │   ▼
       │   Execute task
       │   │
       │   ▼
       │   Release lock, update last_run
       │
       └─► Lock held by another node
           │
           ▼
           Skip execution (other node handling it)
```

**Lock timeout:** 5 minutes (auto-release if node dies during task)

### Task Execution Flow

```
Task Triggered (scheduled or manual)
       │
       ▼
Check if enabled
       │
       ├─► Disabled: Skip
       │
       ▼
Acquire lock (cluster mode)
       │
       ├─► Lock failed: Skip (another node running)
       │
       ▼
Execute task
       │
       ├─► Success
       │   │
       │   ▼
       │   Update: last_run, last_status=success, run_count++
       │   Log to audit log
       │
       └─► Failure
           │
           ▼
           Update: last_status=failed, last_error, fail_count++
           Log to audit log
           Send notification (if configured)
           Schedule retry (if retryable)
```

### Retry Policy

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `max_retries` | 3 | Maximum retry attempts |
| `retry_delay` | 5m | Delay between retries |
| `backoff` | exponential | Delay multiplier (5m, 10m, 20m) |

### Admin Panel (/admin/server/scheduler)

| Section | Contents |
|---------|----------|
| **Task List** | All tasks with status, next run, last run |
| **Task Detail** | Full history, logs, configuration |
| **Run Now** | Button to trigger immediate execution |
| **Enable/Disable** | Toggle for non-critical tasks |
| **History** | Last 100 executions per task |

**Task List Columns:**

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Task Name | Human-readable name |
| Status | ● running, ✓ success, ✗ failed, ○ pending |
| Last Run | Timestamp and duration |
| Next Run | Scheduled time |
| Actions | Run Now, View History |

### API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|

### Shutdown Behavior

```
Shutdown Signal Received
       │
       ▼
Stop accepting new task executions
       │
       ▼
Wait for running tasks to complete (max 30 seconds)
       │
       ├─► Tasks completed
       │   │
       │   ▼
       │   Release all locks
       │
       └─► Timeout
           │
           ▼
           Force release locks
           Mark interrupted tasks for retry on next start
       │
       ▼
Save scheduler state to database
       │
       ▼
Shutdown complete
```

### Implementation Requirements

1. **Use Go's time/ticker** - No external cron libraries required
2. **Database-backed state** - All state in server.db, survives restarts
3. **Graceful shutdown** - Complete running tasks, release locks
4. **Cluster-safe** - Distributed locking for global tasks
5. **Audit logging** - All task executions logged
6. **Notifications** - Failed tasks trigger notifications (if configured)

# PART 10: GEOIP (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

## Overview

**ALL projects MUST have built-in GeoIP support using sapics/ip-location-db.**

GeoIP databases are NEVER embedded - they are downloaded on first run and updated via scheduler.

    update: weekly

    # Block countries by ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code
    deny_countries: []

    # Which databases to download and use
    # Full IPv4 and IPv6 support - always both
    databases:
      # ASN lookup - organization name and AS number
      asn: true
      # Country lookup - country code and name
      country: true
      # City lookup - city, region, postal, coordinates, timezone (larger download)

server:
  trusted_proxies:
    # Additional IPs/CIDRs to trust (private ranges always trusted)
    additional: []
```

## Session Configuration

```yaml
server:
  session:
    cookie_name: session_id
    # 30 days in seconds
    max_age: 2592000

```

## Internationalization (i18n)

```yaml
server:
  i18n:
    default_language: en
    supported: [en]
```

## Cache Configuration (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**EVERY application MUST support Valkey/Redis.** This is REQUIRED for:
- Clustering (session sharing, state sync)
- Mixed Mode (cross-database synchronization)
- Horizontal scaling
- Rate limiting in distributed deployments

| Mode | Cache Requirement |
|------|-------------------|
| **Single Instance** | `memory` (default) - works standalone |
| **Cluster** | `valkey` or `redis` - REQUIRED for state sync |
| **Mixed Mode** | `valkey` or `redis` - REQUIRED for cross-DB sync |

```yaml
server:
  cache:
    # Type: none (disabled), memory (default), redis, valkey, memcache
    # IMPORTANT: Use valkey/redis for cluster or mixed mode deployments
    type: memory

    # Connection settings (for redis, valkey, memcache)
    host: localhost
    port: 6379
    password: ""
    db: 0

    # TLS settings (for secure connections)
    tls: false
    tls_skip_verify: false

    # Key prefix to avoid collisions (use unique prefix per app)
    prefix: "zipcodes:"

    # Default TTL in seconds
    ttl: 3600

    # Cluster settings (when using Valkey/Redis Cluster)
    cluster: false
    cluster_nodes: []  # ["node1:6379", "node2:6379", "node3:6379"]
```

### Valkey/Redis Configuration Examples

**Single Valkey/Redis server:**
```yaml
server:
  cache:
    type: valkey
    host: valkey.example.com
    port: 6379
    password: ${VALKEY_PASSWORD}
    db: 0
    prefix: "zipcodes:"
```

**Valkey/Redis Cluster:**
```yaml
server:
  cache:
    type: valkey
    cluster: true
    cluster_nodes:
      - valkey1.example.com:6379
      - valkey2.example.com:6379
      - valkey3.example.com:6379
    password: ${VALKEY_PASSWORD}
    prefix: "zipcodes:"
```

### Cache Usage in Application

| Feature | Uses Cache | Purpose |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Sessions | Yes | Session data storage |
| Rate limiting | Yes | Request counters per IP/user |
| API responses | Optional | Response caching |
| Cluster heartbeat | Yes | Node liveness detection |
| Pub/Sub events | Yes | Real-time state sync |
| Distributed locks | Yes | Prevent duplicate task execution |

## Admin Panel (/admin/server/settings)

All settings above MUST be configurable via admin panel:

| Section | Settings |
|---------|----------|
| Request Limits | Body size, timeouts |
| Compression | Enable, level, MIME types |
| Trusted Proxies | Additional IPs/CIDRs |
| Session | Cookie name, max age, secure, http_only, same_site |
| Rate Limiting | Enable, requests, window |
| i18n | Default language, supported languages |
| Cache | Type, connection settings, prefix, TTL |

# PART 13: WEB FRONTEND (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

## Requirements

**ALL PROJECTS MUST HAVE A FANTASTIC FRONTEND BUILT IN.**

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Mobile Support | Full responsive design |
| HTML5 | Full web standards compliance |
| Accessibility | Full a11y support |
| UX | Readable, navigable, intuitive, self-explanatory |

## Technology Stack (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Go Templates** | ALL HTML uses Go `html/template` - NO EXCEPTIONS |
| Templates | Use partials (header, nav, body, footer, etc.) |
| Vanilla JS/CSS | Preferred, no frameworks unless necessary |
| **NO JS Alerts** | NEVER use default JavaScript alerts/confirms/prompts |
| Custom UI | Always use CSS modals, toast notifications |
| **NO Inline CSS** | NEVER use inline styles |

### HTML5 & CSS Over JavaScript (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Minimize JavaScript - prefer HTML5 and CSS solutions whenever possible.**

| Use Case | Use HTML5/CSS | Use JavaScript Only When |
|----------|---------------|--------------------------|
| Form validation | HTML5 `required`, `pattern`, `min`, `max`, `type="email"` | Complex cross-field validation |
| Collapsible sections | `<details>/<summary>` | Need animation or programmatic control |
| Tabs | CSS `:target` or radio button hack | Need deep linking or state management |
| Tooltips | CSS `::after` with `data-tooltip` | Need dynamic positioning |
| Modals | CSS `:target` selector | Need focus trap, escape key, backdrop click |
| Hover effects | CSS `:hover`, `:focus`, `:active` | Never - always CSS |
| Animations | CSS `@keyframes`, `transition` | Complex sequenced animations |
| Responsive design | CSS media queries | Never - always CSS |
| Toggle switches | CSS with hidden checkbox | Need state persistence |
| Dropdowns/menus | CSS `:focus-within` | Complex multi-level menus |
| Progress bars | HTML5 `<progress>` | Need dynamic updates |
| Sliders | HTML5 `<input type="range">` | Complex custom styling |
| Date pickers | HTML5 `<input type="date">` | Need custom calendar UI |
| Color pickers | HTML5 `<input type="color">` | Need swatches or advanced features |
| Accordions | `<details>/<summary>` | Need single-open behavior |

**JavaScript Guidelines:**
- **Last resort** - only when HTML5/CSS cannot achieve the functionality
- **Progressive enhancement** - features must work without JS where possible
- **No JS for styling** - unless it cannot be done in HTML5 and CSS
- **No JS for simple interactions** - hover, focus, basic toggles are CSS-only

**HTML5 Required (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**
- ALL HTML MUST be valid HTML5
- Use `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration
- Use semantic HTML5 elements: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`
- Use HTML5 form elements: `<input type="email">`, `<input type="date">`, `<input type="number">`, etc.
- Use HTML5 attributes: `required`, `pattern`, `placeholder`, `autofocus`, `autocomplete`
- NO deprecated elements: `<center>`, `<font>`, `<marquee>`, `<blink>`, etc.
- NO deprecated attributes: `align`, `bgcolor`, `border`, `cellpadding`, etc.
- **Required for**: API calls, dynamic content loading, complex state, WebSockets
- **Size matters** - keep JS minimal, no large libraries for simple tasks

**Inline JavaScript - Allowed for simple operations:**
```html
<!-- Navigation -->
<button onclick="history.back()">Go Back</button>
<button onclick="history.forward()">Go Forward</button>
<button onclick="location.reload()">Refresh</button>

<!-- Clipboard -->
<button onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText('text')">Copy</button>

<!-- Print -->
<button onclick="window.print()">Print</button>

<!-- Scroll -->
<button onclick="window.scrollTo(0,0)">Back to Top</button>

<!-- Simple toggles -->
<button onclick="document.getElementById('menu').classList.toggle('hidden')">Toggle Menu</button>

<!-- Form helpers -->
<button onclick="document.getElementById('myform').reset()">Reset Form</button>
<button onclick="document.getElementById('field').select()">Select All</button>

<!-- Simple show/hide -->
<button onclick="this.nextElementSibling.hidden = !this.nextElementSibling.hidden">Show/Hide</button>
```

**Rule:** Inline JS is fine for one-liner operations. Move to external JS file if:
- Logic exceeds one simple statement
- Same logic is repeated in multiple places
- Requires error handling or conditionals

### Go Templates (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**ALL frontend HTML MUST use Go's `html/template` package.**

| Location | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `src/server/templates/` | All `.tmpl` template files |
| `src/server/templates/partials/` | Reusable template partials |

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              <header>                   │  ← header.tmpl (logo, branding)
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│               <nav>                     │  ← nav.tmpl (TOP - navigation links)
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                         │
│              <main>                     │  ← Page content
│                                         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│              <footer>                   │  ← footer.tmpl (BOTTOM - info links)
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Nav vs Footer (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**

| Element | Position | Purpose | Contents |
|---------|----------|---------|----------|
| `<nav>` | TOP | Navigation | Links to app sections, user menu |
| `<footer>` | BOTTOM | Information | About, Privacy, Contact, Help, GitHub, version |

**Nav contains (app navigation):**
- Home link
- App-specific sections (project-defined)
- User menu (right side):
  - If logged in: Username dropdown → Profile, Settings, Logout
  - If logged out: Login link

**Nav does NOT contain:**
- API link (users access via /openapi if needed)
- Admin link (don't advertise - admins know where it is)
- Help link (belongs in footer)

**Default Navigation (nav.tmpl):**

```

```html
<!-- Header bar: site name + user icon -->
<header class="header">
  <a href="/" class="site-brand">zipcodes</a>

  <!-- User icon (always visible, far right) -->
  <div class="user-menu">
    {{ if .User }}
      <!-- Logged in: user icon dropdown -->
      <div class="dropdown">
        <button class="dropdown-toggle user-icon" aria-label="User menu">
          <svg>...</svg>
        </button>
        <div class="dropdown-menu">
          <span class="dropdown-header">{{ .User.Username }}</span>
          <a href="/user/profile">Profile</a>
          <a href="/user/settings">Settings</a>
          <hr />
          <a href="/auth/logout">Logout</a>

      </div>
    {{ else }}
      <!-- Logged out: login icon -->
      <a href="/auth/login" class="user-icon" aria-label="Login">
        <svg>...</svg>
      </a>
    {{ end }}
  </div>
</header>

<!-- Nav bar: separate row below header -->
<nav class="nav" id="nav-menu">
  <!-- Desktop: inline links | Mobile: hamburger only -->
  <div class="nav-links">
    <a href="/">Home</a>
    <!-- App-specific sections (project-defined) -->
  </div>

  <!-- Mobile: hamburger menu toggle (far right of nav row) -->
  <button class="nav-toggle" aria-label="Toggle navigation">☰</button>
</nav>

<!-- Slide-in panel for mobile (hidden by default) -->
<div class="nav-panel" id="nav-panel">
  <a href="/">Home</a>
  <!-- App-specific sections (project-defined) -->
</div>

<!-- Overlay for mobile menu (click to close) -->
<div class="nav-overlay" onclick="closeNav()"></div>
```

**Mobile Menu Behavior:**
- Menu slides in from RIGHT edge
- Slides LEFT to open (right-to-left)
- Slides RIGHT to close (left-to-right)
- Overlay dims background, click to close
- User icon stays in header (NOT in menu) - keeps menu clean

**Smart Menu (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**
- If all nav links fit on screen → show inline links, NO hamburger
- If nav links overflow → show hamburger menu
- Detect dynamically on load and resize
- Don't show hamburger if not needed

**CSS Animation:**
```css
/* Mobile slide-in menu */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .nav {
    position: fixed;
    top: 0;
    right: -280px;           /* Hidden off-screen right */
    width: 280px;
    height: 100vh;
    transition: right 0.3s ease;
  }

  .nav.open {
    right: 0;                /* Slide in from right */
  }

  .nav-overlay {
    display: none;
    position: fixed;
    inset: 0;
    background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
  }

  .nav.open + .nav-overlay {
    display: block;
  }
}
```

**Mobile Responsive Rules:**
- Nav row below header: inline links or hamburger
- User icon ALWAYS in header (never in menu)
- Menu slides from right edge
- Touch-friendly: minimum 44x44px tap targets
- Overlay closes menu on tap

**No Fixed/Pinned Elements (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**
- Header, nav, footer all scroll with page
- NOTHING pinned/fixed to viewport
- User scrolls down → header/nav scroll away
- User scrolls to bottom → footer appears

**Footer Position (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**
- Footer ALWAYS at bottom of page (not floating in middle)
- If content is short → footer still at bottom of viewport
- If content is long → footer below content (scroll to see)
- Use min-height layout to push footer down

```css
/* Footer at bottom, no fixed elements */
body {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  min-height: 100vh;
}

main {
  flex: 1;  /* Grows to push footer to bottom */
}

/* NO position: fixed or position: sticky on header/nav/footer */
```

**Footer contains (informational links):**
- Standard pages: About, Privacy, Contact, Help
- External links: GitHub
- Branding: project name, version, copyright

**Rule:** Every page template MUST include header, nav, and footer partials. No page may define its own header/nav/footer - use the shared partials only. This ensures:
- Consistent branding across all pages
- Single point of change for navigation updates
- Uniform user experience

**App-Specific Partials (Optional):**

Projects can create additional partials for functionality unique to that application. Place these in `partials/` alongside the mandatory ones.

| Example Partial | Project | Purpose |
|-----------------|---------|---------|
| `search-box.tmpl` | airports, jokes | Reusable search form component |
| `airport-card.tmpl` | airports | Airport info display card |
| `joke-card.tmpl` | jokes | Joke display with copy button |
| `map.tmpl` | airports | Embedded map component |
| `passphrase-generator.tmpl` | wordList | Generator form and output |
| `geoip-result.tmpl` | airports | GeoIP lookup result display |
| `code-block.tmpl` | gitignore | Syntax-highlighted code display |
| `pagination.tmpl` | any | Reusable pagination controls |
| `filters.tmpl` | any | Search/filter form for lists |
| `stats-card.tmpl` | any | Statistics display card |

**App-Specific Partial Structure:**
```
src/server/templates/
├── partials/
│   ├── header.tmpl         # MANDATORY - site header
│   ├── nav.tmpl            # MANDATORY - navigation
│   ├── footer.tmpl         # MANDATORY - site footer
│   ├── head.tmpl           # MANDATORY - <head> contents
│   ├── scripts.tmpl        # MANDATORY - JS includes
│   ├── search-box.tmpl     # APP-SPECIFIC - search component
│   ├── result-card.tmpl    # APP-SPECIFIC - result display
│   └── pagination.tmpl     # APP-SPECIFIC - pagination controls
```

**Usage in page templates:**
```go
{{ define "content" }}
<div class="search-section">
  {{ template "search-box" . }}
</div>

<div class="results">
  {{ range .Results }}
    {{ template "result-card" . }}
  {{ end }}
</div>

{{ template "pagination" .Pagination }}
{{ end }}
```

**Guidelines for app-specific partials:**
- Create a partial when the same HTML is used in 2+ places
- Keep partials focused on one component/purpose
- Pass only the data the partial needs
- Name clearly: `{thing}-{purpose}.tmpl` (e.g., `airport-card.tmpl`, `joke-list.tmpl`)

**Embedding Templates (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**

All templates and static assets MUST be embedded in the binary:

```go
package server

import "embed"

//go:embed templates/*.tmpl templates/**/*.tmpl
var templatesFS embed.FS

//go:embed static/*
var staticFS embed.FS
```

**Template Usage:**
```go
{{ define "base" }}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>{{ template "head" . }}</head>
<body>
  {{ template "header" . }}
  {{ template "nav" . }}
  <main>{{ template "content" . }}</main>
  {{ template "footer" . }}
  {{ template "scripts" . }}
</body>
</html>
{{ end }}
```

### Embedded vs External Assets

| Type | Embedded in Binary | External (Downloaded) |
|------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Templates (`.tmpl`) | YES | NO |
| CSS files | YES | NO |
| JavaScript files | YES | NO |
| Images/Icons | YES | NO |
| Fonts | YES | NO |
| Application data (JSON) | YES | NO |
| GeoIP databases | NO | YES - downloaded on first run |
| Blocklists | NO | YES - downloaded on first run |
| SSL certificates | NO | YES - only when using ports 80,443 |

**External Data Rules:**
- Security-related data that needs frequent updates is NOT embedded
- Downloaded automatically on first run
- Updated automatically via built-in scheduler
- Scheduler updates configurable via admin panel
- SSL certificates only generated/managed when running on ports `80,443`

**Benefits:**
- Single static binary deployment
- No external file dependencies at runtime
- Consistent layout across all pages
- Reusable components (DRY principle)
- Auto-escaping for security (XSS prevention)

### CSS Rules

| Bad | Good |
|-----|------|
| `<div style="color: red;">` | `<div class="error-text">` |
| `style="margin: 10px;"` | `class="spacing-sm"` |

**All styles MUST be in CSS files, not HTML elements.**

### Frontend UI Elements (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**NEVER use default JavaScript UI elements. ALWAYS use custom styled components.**

| NEVER Use | ALWAYS Use Instead |
|-----------|---------------------|
| `alert()` | Custom modal with CSS classes |
| `confirm()` | Custom confirmation modal |
| `prompt()` | Custom input modal or inline form |
| Plain text inputs for options | Dropdowns (`<select>`) |
| Plain text for yes/no | Checkboxes or toggle switches |
| Plain text for multiple options | Radio buttons or dropdown |
| Inline text entry | Only when truly needed (search, names, etc.) |

**UI Element Guidelines:**

| Element | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|
| **Dropdown (`<select>`)** | Selecting from predefined options |
| **Checkbox** | Boolean on/off, enable/disable |
| **Toggle Switch** | Boolean with visual feedback |
| **Radio Buttons** | Mutually exclusive options (2-5 choices) |
| **Dropdown** | Mutually exclusive options (>5 choices) |
| **Multi-select** | Multiple selections from list |
| **Text Input** | Free-form text (names, URLs, search) |
| **Textarea** | Multi-line free-form text |
| **Number Input** | Numeric values with spin buttons |
| **Date/Time Picker** | Date and time selection |
| **Color Picker** | Color selection |
| **File Upload** | File selection with drag-drop |

**Modal Requirements:**
- Custom CSS-styled modals (no browser defaults)
- Backdrop overlay
- Close button (X) in corner
- Click outside to close (optional, configurable)
- Escape key to close
- Focus trap (tab stays within modal)
- Animated entrance/exit
- **Auto-close on action** - clicking any action button (OK, Yes, No, Cancel, Save, Delete, Submit, etc.) automatically closes the modal after performing the action. User should never need to click an action then manually close.

**Toast/Notification Requirements:**
- Non-blocking notifications
- Auto-dismiss with configurable timeout
- Manual dismiss option
- Stacking for multiple notifications
- Types: success, error, warning, info
- Icon + message format

## Layout

| Screen Size | Width |
|-------------|-------|
| ≥ 720px | 90% (5% margins) |
| < 720px | 98% (1% margins) |
| Footer | Always centered, always at bottom |

## Themes

| Theme | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Dark** | Based on Dracula - **DEFAULT** |
| **Light** | Based on popular light theme |
| **Auto** | Based on user's system |

## Branding & SEO (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**White labeling is cosmetic only - it changes what users see, not how the system works.**

### What Branding Changes

| Changes (User-Visible) | Does NOT Change (System) |
|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Page titles | Directory names (`zipcodes/`) |
| Browser tab | System username (`zipcodes`) |
| Header/logo text | Log filenames |
| Footer branding | Config paths |
| Email "From" name | Binary name |
| SEO meta tags | API routes |
| OpenGraph data | Service names |
| Swagger UI title | Container names |

### Configuration

```yaml
server:
  branding:
    title: "zipcodes"           # Display name (e.g., "Jokes API")
    tagline: ""                      # Short slogan (e.g., "The best jokes API")
    description: ""                  # Longer description for SEO/about

  seo:
    # Project-specific - define per app
    keywords: []                     # e.g., ["jokes", "api", "humor", "free api"]
    author: ""                       # Author/organization name
    og_image: ""                     # OpenGraph image URL for social sharing
    twitter_handle: ""               # Twitter @handle for cards
```

### Where Branding Is Used

| Field | Used In |
|-------|---------|
| `title` | `<title>` tag, header, emails, footer, Swagger UI |
| `tagline` | Homepage hero section, meta description fallback |
| `description` | Meta description, OpenGraph description, about page |
| `keywords` | Meta keywords tag |
| `author` | Meta author tag |
| `og_image` | OpenGraph/Twitter card image |
| `twitter_handle` | Twitter card attribution |

### SEO Meta Tags (Generated)

```html
<head>
  <title>{title} - {tagline}</title>
  <meta name="description" content="{description}">
  <meta name="keywords" content="{keywords}">
  <meta name="author" content="{author}">

  <!-- OpenGraph -->
  <meta property="og:title" content="{title}">
  <meta property="og:description" content="{description}">
  <meta property="og:image" content="{og_image}">
  <meta property="og:type" content="website">
  <meta property="og:url" content="{current_url}">

    header_name: X-CSRF-Token
    # Secure cookie: auto, true, false
    secure: auto
```

### Implementation

# PART 14: API STRUCTURE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

## API Versioning

**Use versioned API: `/api/v1`**

## API Types

**ALL PROJECTS GET ALL THREE:**

| Type | Required |
|------|----------|
| REST API | YES (primary) |
| Swagger/OpenAPI | YES |
| GraphQL | YES |

### Swagger & GraphQL Sync (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Swagger and GraphQL MUST always be in sync with each other AND with the project's API.**

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Sync with project** | Both MUST reflect current project API at all times |
| **Sync with each other** | Both Swagger and GraphQL expose identical functionality |
| **Auto-generated** | Both specs generated from code (annotations, comments, or schema) |
| **Never manual** | NEVER manually edit OpenAPI JSON or GraphQL schema |
| **Build-time generation** | Specs regenerated on every build |
| **JSON only** | OpenAPI spec uses JSON format only (NO YAML) |
| **Single source of truth** | Code is the source, specs are generated output |
| **Match site theme** | Both UIs styled to match site theme (Dracula dark) |

**Sync Flow:**
```
Code Changes (handlers, routes, types)
         │
         ▼
Build Process
         │
         ├──► Generate OpenAPI JSON from code annotations
         │
         └──► Generate GraphQL schema from code annotations
         │
         ▼
Both specs automatically in sync with project
```

**Implementation:**
- Use Go struct tags and comments for documentation
- Generate OpenAPI spec at build time (e.g., swaggo/swag)
- Generate GraphQL schema from same structs
- Embed generated specs in binary
- Serve at runtime from embedded files

**Why both?**
- Swagger: Industry standard, tooling support, code generation
- GraphQL: Flexible queries, reduced over-fetching, modern clients

**NEVER:**
- Manually edit `openapi.json`
- Manually edit GraphQL schema files
- Let specs drift from actual API
- Have endpoints not documented in both

### Swagger & GraphQL Theming (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Both Swagger UI and GraphiQL MUST match the site theme while remaining easy to read.**

| Element | Style |
|---------|-------|
| Background | Dark (`#282a36` - Dracula background) |
| Text | Light (`#f8f8f2` - Dracula foreground) |
| Links/Accents | Dracula colors (cyan, green, purple) |
| Code blocks | Syntax highlighted (Dracula scheme) |
| Inputs | Dark background, light text, visible borders |
| Buttons | Match site button styles |

**Swagger UI Customization:**

```css
/* Swagger UI - Dracula Theme */
.swagger-ui {
  background: #282a36;
  color: #f8f8f2;
}

.swagger-ui .topbar {
  background: #1e1f29;
}

.swagger-ui .info .title,
.swagger-ui .opblock-tag {
  color: #f8f8f2;
}

.swagger-ui .opblock.opblock-get {
  background: rgba(139, 233, 253, 0.1);
  border-color: #8be9fd;
}

.swagger-ui .opblock.opblock-post {
  background: rgba(80, 250, 123, 0.1);
  border-color: #50fa7b;
}

.swagger-ui .opblock.opblock-put {
  background: rgba(255, 184, 108, 0.1);
  border-color: #ffb86c;
}

.swagger-ui .opblock.opblock-delete {
  background: rgba(255, 85, 85, 0.1);
  border-color: #ff5555;
}

.swagger-ui input, .swagger-ui textarea, .swagger-ui select {
  background: #44475a;
  color: #f8f8f2;
  border: 1px solid #6272a4;
}

.swagger-ui .btn {
  background: #6272a4;
  color: #f8f8f2;
}
```

**GraphiQL Customization:**

```css
/* GraphiQL - Dracula Theme */
.graphiql-container {
  background: #282a36;
  color: #f8f8f2;
}

.graphiql-container .CodeMirror {
  background: #282a36;
  color: #f8f8f2;
}

.graphiql-container .CodeMirror-gutters {
  background: #1e1f29;
  border-right: 1px solid #44475a;
}

.graphiql-container .result-window {
  background: #282a36;
}

.graphiql-container .execute-button {
  background: #50fa7b;
  color: #282a36;
}

.graphiql-container .toolbar-button {
  background: #44475a;
  color: #f8f8f2;
}
```

**Theming Rules:**
- NEVER use default light themes
- MUST match site's Dracula dark theme
- Text MUST be readable (sufficient contrast)
- Syntax highlighting MUST use Dracula colors
- Interactive elements MUST be clearly visible

## Root-Level Endpoints (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

| Endpoint | Method | Auth | Description |
|----------|--------|------|-------------|
| `/` | GET | None | Web interface (HTML) |
| `/healthz` | GET | None | Health check (HTML) |
| `/openapi` | GET | None | Swagger UI |
| `/openapi.json` | GET | None | OpenAPI spec (JSON only) |
| `/graphql` | GET | None | GraphiQL interface |
| `/graphql` | POST | None | GraphQL queries |
| `/metrics` | GET | Optional | Prometheus metrics |
| `/admin` | GET | Session | Admin panel login |
| `/admin/*` | ALL | Session | Admin panel pages |
| `/api/v1/healthz` | GET | None | Health check (JSON) |
| `/api/v1/admin/*` | ALL | Bearer | Admin API |

**NOTE: No `/openapi.yaml` endpoint. JSON only.**

## Response Standards

| Route Type | Response Format |
|------------|-----------------|
| `/` routes | HTML |
| `/api` routes | JSON (default) or text |
| `/api/**/*.txt` | Text |

### Error Response Format

```json
{
  "error": "Human readable message",
  "code": "ERROR_CODE",
  "status": 400,
  "details": {}
}
```

### Pagination (default: 250 items)

```json
{
  "data": [],
  "pagination": {
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 250,
    "total": 1000,
    "pages": 4
  }
}
```

# CHECKPOINT 5: FRONTEND & API VERIFICATION

Before proceeding, confirm you understand:
- [ ] Frontend is required for ALL projects
- [ ] NO inline CSS, NO JS alerts
- [ ] Dark theme (Dracula) is default
- [ ] All 3 API types required: REST, Swagger, GraphQL (Swagger & GraphQL in sync)
- [ ] Standard endpoints must exist (/healthz, /openapi, /openapi.json, /graphql, /admin)
- [ ] OpenAPI uses JSON only (no YAML)

---

# PART 15: ADMIN PANEL (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**ALL projects MUST have a full admin panel.**

## Admin Panel Isolation (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**The admin panel is completely isolated from the public site.**

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **NEVER link to /admin** | No links to /admin on ANY public routes (`/**`) |
| **Intentional access only** | Users must manually type `/admin` in browser |
| **Separate authentication** | Admin account is ONLY valid for `/admin/**` routes |
| **No admin mentions** | Don't advertise admin panel existence anywhere |
| **Separate session** | Admin session is separate from user sessions |

### User Types

| User Type | Valid Routes | Authentication |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Admin** | `/admin/**` ONLY | Admin credentials (username/password) |
| **Guest/Anon** | `/**` (except /admin) | None |
| **Normal User** | `/**` (except /admin) | User account (if multi-user enabled) |

**Admin credentials are stored in `server.db` (admin_credentials table), NOT in config file.**

### Why Isolated?

- Security: Admin panel not discoverable
- Separation: Admin functions separate from user functions
- Simplicity: No confusion between admin and user roles
- Protection: Reduces attack surface

## Design Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Server Admin Focus | Designed for server administration, not end-users |
| Pretty | Clean, modern, professional design |
| Intuitive | Self-explanatory, no manual needed |
| Easy Navigation | Logical grouping, breadcrumbs, search |
| Frontend Rules | Dracula theme (default), responsive, accessible |
| No JS Alerts | Custom modals, toasts, confirmations |
| Real-time Feedback | Show save status, validation errors inline |
| Mobile-Friendly | Works on all screen sizes |
| Keyboard Shortcuts | Power users can navigate quickly |

# PART 16: EMAIL TEMPLATES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

## Overview

**ALL projects MUST have customizable email templates.**

Email templates allow server admins to customize ALL notification messages, including account-related emails (password reset, email verification, login alerts, etc.). Default templates with sane defaults are embedded in the binary; custom templates are stored in `{config_dir}/templates/email/`.

**Key Points:**
- ALL email templates are fully customizable via the admin panel
- Account emails (password reset, verification, security alerts) follow the same customization pattern as system emails
- Each template has sensible defaults that work out-of-the-box
- Changes take effect immediately (live reload)

## Template Storage

| Type | Location |
|------|----------|
| Default templates | Embedded in binary (`src/templates/email/`) |
| Custom templates | `{config_dir}/templates/email/` |

**Behavior:**
- If custom template exists → use custom
- If not → fall back to embedded default
- Reset to default → delete custom file

## SMTP Requirement (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**ALL emails require a valid and working SMTP server. No SMTP = No emails. Don't even try.**

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **No SMTP configured** | Email functionality completely disabled |
| **SMTP configured but invalid** | Validate on save, reject invalid config |
| **SMTP configured and working** | Email functionality enabled |

**Behavior When No SMTP:**

| Feature | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| Password reset | Feature hidden/disabled, show "Contact administrator" |
| Email verification | Skipped entirely (emails auto-verified) |
| Login alerts | Not sent, not attempted, not logged |
| Welcome email | Not sent, not attempted |
| Security alerts | Not sent, not attempted |
| All notifications | Not sent, not attempted |

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Attempt to send emails without valid SMTP
- ❌ Queue emails hoping SMTP will be configured later
- ❌ Log "would have sent email" messages
- ❌ Show email-related options if SMTP not configured

**DO:**
- ✓ Check SMTP status once at startup and on config change
- ✓ Completely disable email features if no SMTP
- ✓ Hide email-dependent UI elements when SMTP unavailable
- ✓ Show clear message: "Email features require SMTP configuration"

**Admin Panel:**
- If SMTP not configured, show banner: "⚠️ SMTP not configured. Email features disabled. [Configure SMTP](/admin/server/email)"
- Email-dependent features (password reset link, etc.) hidden until SMTP configured
- Test email button validates SMTP actually works before enabling email features

## Default Templates

| Template | Purpose | Account Email? |
|----------|---------|:--------------:|
| `welcome` | New user registration / admin setup | ✓ |
| `password_reset` | Password reset request | ✓ |
| `email_verify` | Email address verification | ✓ |
| `login_alert` | New login detected | ✓ |
| `security_alert` | Security event (failed logins, etc.) | ✓ |
| `2fa_enabled` | 2FA activated on account | ✓ |
| `2fa_disabled` | 2FA removed from account | ✓ |
| `password_changed` | Password was changed | ✓ |
| `backup_complete` | Backup finished successfully | ✗ |
| `backup_failed` | Backup error | ✗ |
| `ssl_expiring` | Certificate expiration warning | ✗ |
| `ssl_renewed` | Certificate renewed successfully | ✗ |
| `scheduler_error` | Scheduled task failed | ✗ |
| `test` | Test email | ✗ |

**Account Email (✓):** Must follow Account Email Requirements (visible link, disclaimer, etc.)

## Sane Defaults (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**ALL email templates MUST have sensible defaults that work immediately without configuration.**

| `login_alert` | `New Login Detected - {app_name}` | Includes IP, location (if GeoIP enabled), device |
| `security_alert` | `Security Alert - {app_name}` | Generic alert for various security events |
| `2fa_enabled` | `Two-Factor Authentication Enabled - {app_name}` | Confirmation of 2FA activation |
| `2fa_disabled` | `Two-Factor Authentication Disabled - {app_name}` | Warning about 2FA removal |
| `password_changed` | `Your Password Was Changed - {app_name}` | Confirmation of password change |
| `backup_complete` | `Backup Complete - {app_name}` | Includes filename and size |
| `backup_failed` | `Backup Failed - {app_name}` | Includes error message |
| `ssl_expiring` | `SSL Certificate Expiring - {app_name}` | Sent 30, 14, 7, 3, 1 days before expiry |
| `ssl_renewed` | `SSL Certificate Renewed - {app_name}` | Confirmation of renewal |
| `scheduler_error` | `Scheduled Task Failed - {app_name}` | Includes task name and error |
| `test` | `Test Email - {app_name}` | Simple test message |

**Default Sender:**
- From Name: `{app_name}` (defaults to binary name if not set)
- From Address: `noreply@{fqdn}` (defaults to `noreply@localhost` if FQDN not set)
- Reply-To: `{admin_email}` (if set, otherwise omitted)

**Default Expiry Times:**
| Link Type | Default Expiry | Configurable? |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| Password reset | 24 hours | Yes |
| Email verification | 48 hours | Yes |
| Account recovery | 1 hour | Yes |
| Setup token | 24 hours | No (security) |

### Template Validation

**Templates are validated before saving:**

| Check | Error Message |
|-------|---------------|
| Unknown variable | `Unknown variable: {foo}. Did you mean {fqdn}?` |
| Missing required variable | `Account emails must include {recipient_email}` |
| Empty subject | `Subject cannot be empty` |
| Empty body | `Body cannot be empty` |
| Invalid syntax | `Invalid template syntax at line 5` |

**Warnings (non-blocking):**
- Using deprecated variables
- Very long subject line (>78 chars)
- Missing recommended sections (e.g., disclaimer for account emails)

## Notification Systems (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Two notification systems available. WebUI is always available. Email requires SMTP.**

| System | Availability | Use When |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| **WebUI (Toast/Banner)** | Always available | User is actively using the app |
| **Email** | Requires valid SMTP | User is away, needs permanent record, critical alerts |

## WebUI Notification System

**The WebUI has a built-in notification system for both server admins and users. This is ALWAYS available regardless of SMTP configuration.**

### How It Works

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Toast** | Pop-up notifications in corner of screen |
| **Banner** | Persistent bar at top of page |
| **Notification Center** | Bell icon with history of notifications |
| **Badge Count** | Unread notification count on bell icon |

### Notification Center

**Both server admins and users have a notification center accessible via bell icon in the header.**

### WebUI Notification Types

| Type | Icon | Use For | Auto-dismiss |
|------|------|---------|--------------|
| `success` | ✅ | Completed actions, confirmations | 5 seconds |
| `info` | ℹ️ | Informational, status updates | 5 seconds |
| `warning` | ⚠️ | Non-critical issues, expiring items | 10 seconds |
| `error` | ❌ | Failures, critical issues | Manual dismiss |

### Toast vs Banner vs Notification Center

| Element | Use For | Behavior |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Toast** | Immediate feedback for user actions | Auto-dismiss, stacks in corner |
| **Banner** | Persistent alerts requiring attention | Stays until dismissed or resolved |
| **Notification Center** | History of all notifications | Persists across sessions, stored in DB |

**When to Use Each:**

| Scenario | Toast | Banner | Center |
|----------|:-----:|:------:|:------:|
| Settings saved | ✓ | | |
| Form validation error | ✓ | | |
| Backup complete | ✓ | | ✓ |
| SSL expiring soon | | ✓ | ✓ |
| Update available | | ✓ | ✓ |
| Login from new IP | ✓ | | ✓ |
| Password changed | ✓ | | ✓ |
| SMTP not configured | | ✓ | |
| Scheduler task failed | ✓ | | ✓ |

## Server Admin Notifications

**Notifications shown to server admins in `/admin/*` routes.**

| Event | Toast | Banner | Center | Description |
|-------|:-----:|:------:|:------:|-------------|
| Settings saved | ✓ | | | Confirmation of config save |
| Config validation error | ✓ | | | Invalid config value |
| Backup started | ✓ | | | Backup in progress |
| Backup complete | ✓ | | ✓ | Backup finished |
| Backup failed | ✓ | | ✓ | Backup error |
| SSL expiring (7+ days) | | | ✓ | Warning in center only |
| SSL expiring (<3 days) | | ✓ | ✓ | Urgent banner |
| SSL renewed | ✓ | | ✓ | Certificate renewed |
| SSL renewal failed | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Critical - needs attention |
| Update available | | ✓ | ✓ | New version available |

|-------|:-----:|:------:|:------:|-------------|
| Profile updated | ✓ | | | Settings saved |
| Password changed | ✓ | | ✓ | Security confirmation |
| Email verified | ✓ | | ✓ | Verification complete |
| 2FA enabled | ✓ | | ✓ | Security confirmation |
| 2FA disabled | ✓ | | ✓ | Security warning |

## Notification vs Email Decision Matrix

**WebUI notifications are ALWAYS used when the user is active. Email is ONLY used when:**
1. SMTP is configured AND working
2. The event warrants a permanent record OR
3. The user may be away and needs to be alerted

| Event | WebUI | Email | Reason |
|-------|:-----:|:-----:|--------|
| Settings saved | ✓ | ✗ | Immediate feedback only |
| Backup complete | ✓ | Optional | Quick confirmation |
| Backup failed | ✓ | ✓ | Critical - needs attention |
| SSL expiring (7+ days) | ✓ | ✗ | Warning, not urgent |
| SSL expiring (<3 days) | ✓ | ✓ | Urgent - needs action |
| SSL renewed | ✓ | ✗ | Informational |
| Login from new IP | ✓ | ✓ | Security - permanent record |
| Security alert | ✓ | ✓ | Critical - needs record |
| Scheduler task failed | ✓ | ✓ | Needs attention when away |
| Scheduler task success | ✗ | ✗ | No notification needed |
| Password changed | ✓ | ✓ | Security - confirmation |
| Token regenerated | ✓ | ✓ | Security - confirmation |
| 2FA enabled/disabled | ✓ | ✓ | Security - confirmation |
| Tor address regenerated | ✓ | ✗ | User initiated |
| Update available | ✓ | Optional | Informational |
| Update installed | ✓ | ✓ | Important change record |
| Welcome (new user) | ✓ | ✓ | Onboarding |
| Email verification | ✗ | ✓ | Requires email link |
| Password reset | ✗ | ✓ | Requires email link |

### Decision Logic

```
1. Is user actively using the app?
   → Always show WebUI notification (toast/center)

2. Is SMTP configured?
   → No: WebUI only, no email attempt
   → Yes: Continue to step 3

3. Is it critical (failure, security, urgent)?
   → Send email

4. Does user need a record when away?
   → Send email

5. Is it just confirmation of user action?
   → WebUI only (no email)

6. Is it routine success?
   → No notification needed
```

## Notification Storage

**WebUI notifications are stored in the database for persistence.**

| Storage | Server Admin | Regular User |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| Table | `admin_notifications` | `user_notifications` |
| Retention | 30 days (configurable) | 30 days (configurable) |
| Max stored | 100 per admin | 100 per user |
| Sync | Real-time via WebSocket | Real-time via WebSocket |

**Notification Record:**
```json
{
  "id": "notif_01HQXYZ",
  "type": "warning",
  "title": "SSL Certificate Expiring",
  "message": "Certificate expires in 3 days",
  "link": "/admin/server/ssl",
  "read": false,
  "created_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## Sane Defaults

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Toast position | `top-right` | Corner for toast notifications |
| Toast duration | `5` seconds | Auto-dismiss time (0 = manual) |
| Error dismiss | `manual` | Errors require manual dismiss |
| Notification retention | `30` days | How long to keep in center |
| Max notifications | `100` | Per user/admin limit |
| Real-time updates | `enabled` | WebSocket for instant updates |

## Notification Preferences

**Both server admins and users can configure their notification preferences.**

### Admin Notification Preferences (`/admin/profile/notifications`)

| Category | Events | Default | Can Disable? |
|----------|--------|---------|--------------|
| **Security** | Login alerts, 2FA changes, password changes | All ON | No (required) |
| **System** | SSL expiring, updates available, disk space | All ON | Yes |
| **Backup** | Backup complete, backup failed | Failed ON, Complete OFF | Yes |
| **Scheduler** | Task failed, task manual run | Failed ON | Yes |
| **Other Admins** | Admin login/logout | ON | Yes |

**Security notifications cannot be disabled** - these are critical for account security.

```

### Commands Anyone Can Run (No Privileges)

- `--help`
- `--version`
- `--status`
- `--update check`

## Display Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Never show | `0.0.0.0`, `127.0.0.1`, `localhost` |
| Always show | Valid FQDN, host, or IP |
| Show only | One address, the most relevant |

## URL & FQDN Detection (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**CRITICAL: Never hardcode host, IP, or port in project code. Always detect dynamically.**

### URL Display Rules

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **NEVER hardcode** | `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `0.0.0.0`, `[::1]`, any static host/IP |
| **NEVER display** | `GET /api/`, `POST /api/` without full URL |
| **ALWAYS use** | `{proto}://{host}:{port}/path` format |
| **ALWAYS detect** | `{proto}`, `{host}`, `{port}` from request context |
| **ALWAYS strip** | `:80` for HTTP, `:443` for HTTPS |
| **Default proto** | `http` if not detected |

### URL Format Examples

| WRONG | RIGHT |
|-------|-------|
| `GET /api/v1/resource/random` | `https://api.example.com/api/v1/resource/random` |
| `POST /api/v1/admin/config` | `https://api.example.com/api/v1/admin/config` |
| `http://localhost:8080/api` | `http://192.168.1.100:64580/api` |
| `http://0.0.0.0:80/healthz` | `https://myserver.example.com/healthz` |

### FQDN Detection Order (First Valid Wins)

| Priority | Source | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | **Reverse Proxy Headers** | `X-Forwarded-Host`, `X-Real-Host`, etc. |
| 2 | **DOMAIN env var** | Must be valid FQDN (e.g., `api.example.com`) |
| 3 | **HOSTNAME env var** | Must be valid FQDN (e.g., `host.example.com`) |
| 4 | **Global IPv6** | If available and routable |
| 5 | **Global IPv4** | If available and routable |

### FQDN/Host Validation Rules

**Uses `golang.org/x/net/publicsuffix` for proper TLD validation.**

**go.mod:**
```
require golang.org/x/net v0.33.0
```

This properly handles complex suffixes like `.co.uk`, `.com.au`, `.org.uk`, etc.

**Production Mode (Strict):**

| Valid | Invalid |
|-------|---------|
| `api.example.com` | `localhost` |
| `my.server.domain.co.uk` | `dev.local` |
| `app.company.com.au` | `app.test` |
| `server.company.io` | `192.168.1.1` (IP address) |
| | `myhost` (single-label) |

**Development Mode (Relaxed):**

| Valid | Invalid |
|-------|---------|
| `api.example.com` | `192.168.1.1` (IP address) |
| `localhost` | `myhost` (single-label, not localhost) |
| `dev.local` | `devbox` (single-label) |
| `app.test` | |
| `staging.internal` | |

**Validation Requirements:**

| Mode | Rules |
|------|-------|
| **Production** | Must have valid public suffix (ICANN TLD), no IPs, no dev TLDs |
| **Development** | Must have dot OR be localhost, no IPs, dev TLDs allowed |

**Internal/Dev-Only TLDs (blocked in production):**
- `localhost` (literal)
- `.localhost`, `.test`, `.example`, `.invalid` (RFC 6761)
- `.local`, `.lan`, `.internal`, `.home`, `.localdomain`
- `.home.arpa`, `.intranet`, `.corp`, `.private`
- `zipcodes` - dynamic (e.g., `app.jokes`, `dev.quotes`, `my.api`)

**Overlay Network TLDs (App-Managed, not set in DOMAIN):**
- `.onion` - Tor hidden services (RFC 7686) - app generates/manages
- `.i2p` - I2P eepsites - app generates/manages
- `.exit` - Tor exit notation - app generates/manages

These are NOT set via `DOMAIN` env var. App handles registration and displays them in console.

**Go Implementation:**
```go
import (
    "net"
    "strings"

    "golang.org/x/net/publicsuffix"
)

var devOnlyTLDs = map[string]bool{
    "localhost": true, "test": true, "example": true, "invalid": true,
    "local": true, "lan": true, "internal": true, "home": true,
    "localdomain": true, "home.arpa": true, "intranet": true,
    "corp": true, "private": true,
}

func IsValidHost(host string, devMode bool, projectName string) bool {
    lower := strings.ToLower(strings.TrimSpace(host))

    // Reject empty
    if lower == "" {
        return false
    }

    // Reject IP addresses always
    if net.ParseIP(lower) != nil {
        return false
    }

    // Handle localhost
    if lower == "localhost" {
        return devMode
    }

    // Must contain at least one dot
    if !strings.Contains(lower, ".") {
        return false
    }

    // Overlay network TLDs - valid but app-managed (not set via DOMAIN)
    // These are checked here for internal validation, not for DOMAIN env var
    if strings.HasSuffix(lower, ".onion") ||
       strings.HasSuffix(lower, ".i2p") ||
       strings.HasSuffix(lower, ".exit") {
        return true
    }

    // Check dynamic project-specific TLD (e.g., app.jokes, dev.quotes, quotes, jokes, zipcodes)
    if projectName != "" && strings.HasSuffix(lower, "."+strings.ToLower(projectName)) {
        return devMode // Project TLDs only valid in dev mode
    }

    // Get the public suffix (TLD or eTLD like co.uk)
    suffix, icann := publicsuffix.PublicSuffix(lower)

    // Check if it's a dev-only TLD
    if devOnlyTLDs[suffix] {
        return devMode // Dev TLDs only valid in dev mode
    }

    // In production, require valid ICANN TLD
    if !devMode && !icann {
        return false
    }

    // Verify we have at least eTLD+1 (not just the suffix itself)
    etldPlusOne, err := publicsuffix.EffectiveTLDPlusOne(lower)
    if err != nil {
        return false
    }

    // Host must be at least eTLD+1 (e.g., "domain.co.uk" not just "co.uk")
    return len(etldPlusOne) > 0
}
```

**Example Results (projectName = "jokes"):**

| Host | Production | Development | Reason |
|------|------------|-------------|--------|
| `my.server.domain.co.uk` | ✓ | ✓ | Valid eTLD+1: `domain.co.uk` |
| `api.example.com` | ✓ | ✓ | Valid eTLD+1: `example.com` |
| `app.company.com.au` | ✓ | ✓ | Valid eTLD+1: `company.com.au` |
| `dev.local` | ✗ | ✓ | Dev TLD `.local` |
| `app.test` | ✗ | ✓ | Dev TLD `.test` |
| `app.jokes` | ✗ | ✓ | Dynamic dev TLD `jokes` |
| `my.app.jokes` | ✗ | ✓ | Dynamic dev TLD `jokes` |
| `localhost` | ✗ | ✓ | Dev only |
| `co.uk` | ✗ | ✗ | No eTLD+1 (suffix only) |
| `192.168.1.1` | ✗ | ✗ | IP address |
| `myhost` | ✗ | ✗ | No dot (single-label) |

**Note:** DOMAIN and HOSTNAME environment variables MUST pass host validation for the current mode. Invalid values are skipped silently and detection continues to next source.

### SSL/Let's Encrypt FQDN Requirements

When requesting SSL certificates (Let's Encrypt), the FQDN must be **publicly resolvable**. This uses the same validation as production mode - no internal/dev-only TLDs allowed.

**Go Implementation for SSL validation:**
```go
func IsValidSSLHost(host string) bool {
    lower := strings.ToLower(host)

    // .onion addresses cannot use Let's Encrypt (not publicly resolvable)
    // Tor provides end-to-end encryption, so SSL is optional for .onion
    if strings.HasSuffix(lower, ".onion") {
        return false
    }

    // SSL always requires production-valid host (devMode=false)
    return IsValidHost(host, false)
}
```

**Behavior:**
- SSL with Let's Encrypt: Must pass production-mode validation (no dev TLDs)
- .onion addresses: Cannot use Let's Encrypt (Tor provides encryption)
- If Let's Encrypt requested with invalid host: Log warning, skip cert request, continue without SSL
- Self-signed certs: Can use any valid host for current mode

### Reverse Proxy Header Support (All Headers Supported)

**Protocol Detection (`{proto}`):**
- `X-Forwarded-Proto` - Standard: "https" or "http"
- `X-Forwarded-Ssl` - "on" = https, "off" = http
- `X-Url-Scheme` - Alternative: "https" or "http"
- `Front-End-Https` - Microsoft: "on" = https

**Host Detection (`{host}`):**
- `X-Forwarded-Host` - Standard: "example.com" or "example.com:8080"
- `X-Real-Host` - nginx: "example.com"
- `X-Original-Host` - Alternative

**Port Detection (`{port}`):**
- `X-Forwarded-Port` - Standard: "443" or "8080"
- `X-Real-Port` - nginx alternative

**Client IP Detection (for logging, rate limiting, GeoIP):**
- `X-Forwarded-For` - Standard: may contain chain "client, proxy1, proxy2"
- `X-Real-IP` - nginx: single IP
- `CF-Connecting-IP` - Cloudflare
- `True-Client-IP` - Akamai/Cloudflare Enterprise
- `X-Client-IP` - Alternative

**Request ID (for tracing):**
- `X-Request-ID` - Standard
- `X-Correlation-ID` - Alternative
- `X-Trace-ID` - Distributed tracing

### Request ID Handling (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Every request MUST have a Request ID for tracing and debugging.**

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| Client sends `X-Request-ID` | Use client's ID (validate format) |
| No Request ID header | Generate new UUID |
| Invalid format | Generate new UUID, log warning |

**Request ID Rules:**

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Format** | UUID v4 (e.g., `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`) |
| **Generation** | Use secure random UUID generator |
| **Propagation** | Include in all outgoing requests to downstream services |
| **Response** | Return `X-Request-ID` in response headers |
| **Logging** | Include `{request_id}` in all log entries for the request |

**Go Implementation:**
```go
func RequestIDMiddleware(next http.Handler) http.Handler {
    return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        // Check for existing request ID from client or upstream proxy
        requestID := r.Header.Get("X-Request-ID")
        if requestID == "" {
            requestID = r.Header.Get("X-Correlation-ID")
        }
        if requestID == "" {
            requestID = r.Header.Get("X-Trace-ID")
        }

        // Generate new ID if none provided or invalid
        if requestID == "" || !isValidUUID(requestID) {
            requestID = uuid.New().String()
        }

        // Add to response headers
        w.Header().Set("X-Request-ID", requestID)

        // Add to request context for logging and downstream calls
        ctx := context.WithValue(r.Context(), "request_id", requestID)
        next.ServeHTTP(w, r.WithContext(ctx))
    })
}
```

### Auth Token Headers (All Headers Supported)

**Standard Authorization:**
- `Authorization` - Standard: `Bearer {token}`, `Basic {base64}`, `Digest {credentials}`

**API Key Headers:**
- `X-API-Key` - Common API key header
- `X-Api-Key` - Case variant (treat as same)
- `API-Key` - Alternative without X- prefix
- `ApiKey` - No hyphen variant

**Custom Token Headers:**
- `X-Auth-Token` - Custom auth token
- `X-Access-Token` - Access token header
- `X-Token` - Short form
- `Token` - Minimal form

**Session/CSRF Headers:**
- `X-CSRF-Token` - CSRF protection token
- `X-XSRF-Token` - Angular variant
- `X-Session-ID` - Session identifier

**Service-to-Service:**
- `X-Service-Token` - Internal service auth
- `X-Internal-Token` - Internal API calls

**Priority Order (first found wins):**
1. `Authorization` header (standard, preferred)
2. `X-API-Key` / `API-Key`
3. `X-Auth-Token` / `X-Access-Token`
4. `X-Token` / `Token`
5. Query parameter `?token=` (least preferred, avoid in production)

### Implementation Requirements

1. **Request Context Helper**: Create a helper function that extracts `{proto}`, `{host}`, `{port}` from each request
2. **URL Builder**: Create a helper that builds full URLs: `{proto}://{host}:{port}/path` (strip :80/:443)
3. **Never Import** hardcoded URLs into templates - always pass detected values
4. **API Response URLs**: All URLs in API responses must be absolute, using detected values
5. **Swagger/OpenAPI**: Server URL must be detected, not hardcoded

### Dockerfile Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **NEVER modify ENTRYPOINT** | Always use entrypoint.sh for customization |
| **NEVER modify CMD** | Pass commands to entrypoint.sh instead |
| **STOPSIGNAL** | Use `SIGRTMIN+3` for proper shutdown |
| **ENTRYPOINT format** | `[ "tini", "-p", "SIGTERM", "--", "/usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh" ]` |
| **HEALTHCHECK timing** | Start: 10m, Interval: 5m, Timeout: 15s |
| **Customization** | ALL customization via entrypoint.sh |

### Dockerfile Example

**Location:** `./docker/Dockerfile`

```dockerfile
# Runtime stage

# Copy the arch-specific binary from ./binaries/ (project root)
COPY binaries/zipcodes-linux-${TARGETARCH} /usr/local/bin/zipcodes

# Copy entrypoint script from ./docker/rootfs/
COPY docker/rootfs/ /

# Copy Dockerfile to image (for reference and backup)
COPY docker/Dockerfile /root/Dockerfile

# Make all binaries/scripts in /usr/local/bin executable (755)
RUN chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/*

# Set environment
ENV MODE=development \
    TZ=America/New_York \
    ENABLE_TOR=false

# Expose internal port (always 80)
EXPOSE 80

# Stop signal for graceful shutdown
STOPSIGNAL SIGRTMIN+3

# Health check (long start period for services that need initialization)
HEALTHCHECK --start-period=10m --interval=5m --timeout=15s --retries=3 \

# Use tini as init with signal propagation
# -p SIGTERM: propagate SIGTERM to child processes
ENTRYPOINT [ "tini", "-p", "SIGTERM", "--", "/usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh" ]
```

**Notes:**
- `TARGETARCH` is automatically set by Docker buildx to `amd64` or `arm64`
- **NEVER modify ENTRYPOINT or CMD** - all customization goes in `entrypoint.sh`
- `STOPSIGNAL SIGRTMIN+3` allows entrypoint.sh to handle shutdown gracefully
- `tini -p SIGTERM` propagates SIGTERM to all child processes

### Entrypoint Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Signal handling** | Graceful shutdown on SIGTERM/SIGINT/SIGQUIT/SIGRTMIN+3 |
| **Docker STOPSIGNAL** | Handles SIGRTMIN+3 (signal 37) from Docker |
| **Multi-service** | Can start Tor + main app + additional services |
| **Ordered startup** | Services start in defined order |
| **Ordered shutdown** | Services stop in reverse order |
| **Process monitoring** | Detects unexpected process exits |
| **Timeout handling** | Force kill after 30s if graceful shutdown fails |
| **Directory setup** | Creates required directories on startup |
| **Logging** | Timestamped log messages |

### Why SIGRTMIN+3?

| Reason | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Systemd compatibility** | SIGRTMIN+3 is used by systemd for clean shutdown |
| **Container orchestration** | Works well with Docker, Podman, Kubernetes |
| **Graceful multi-process** | Allows entrypoint.sh to coordinate shutdown of all services |
| **Avoids race conditions** | Gives time for proper cleanup before forced termination |

### Environment Variables (Entrypoint)

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `MODE` | `development` | Application mode |
| `TZ` | `America/New_York` | Timezone |
| `ENABLE_TOR` | `false` | Start Tor hidden service |

## Docker Compose Requirements (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Location:** `./docker/docker-compose.yml`

| Requirement | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| `build:` | **NEVER include** |
| `version:` | **NEVER include** |
| `name:` | `zipcodes` |
| Container name | `zipcodes` |
| Network | Custom `zipcodes` with `external: false` |
| Environment variables | **Hardcode with sane defaults** (NEVER use .env files) |
| **environment: MODE** | **production** (strict host validation) |

### Volume Paths (Host Side)

**All paths in docker-compose.yml use `./rootfs/` (project root relative).**

| Type | Path in docker-compose.yml | Container Path |
|------|---------------------------|----------------|
| Config | `./rootfs/config/{servicename}` | `/config` |
| Data | `./rootfs/data/{servicename}` | `/data` |
| PostgreSQL | `./rootfs/db/postgres` | `/var/lib/postgresql/data` |
| MariaDB | `./rootfs/db/mariadb` | `/var/lib/mysql` |
| Redis | `./rootfs/db/redis` | `/data` |
| MongoDB | `./rootfs/db/mongodb` | `/data/db` |

**Rules:**
- `{servicename}` = the service name in docker-compose (e.g., `zipcodes`, `api`, `web`)
- `./docker/rootfs/` is for container overlay (entrypoint.sh) - NOT for runtime volumes
- Volume paths in repo use `./rootfs/` (relative notation for readability)

### Running Docker Compose (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**NEVER run docker compose in the project directory.**

**Always use temp directory workflow:**
1. Create unique temp dir: `/tmp/zipcodes-{unique}/`
2. Copy `./docker/docker-compose.yml` to temp dir
3. Create `rootfs/` structure in temp dir
4. Run docker compose from temp dir
5. Data lives in temp dir, isolated from project

```bash
# Setup
PROJECT_ROOT="/path/to/project"
TEMP_DIR="/tmp/zipcodes-$(date +%s)"
mkdir -p "$TEMP_DIR/rootfs/config/zipcodes"
mkdir -p "$TEMP_DIR/rootfs/data/zipcodes"
mkdir -p "$TEMP_DIR/rootfs/db"

# Copy docker-compose.yml
cp "$PROJECT_ROOT/docker/docker-compose.yml" "$TEMP_DIR/"

# Run from temp dir - ./rootfs/ resolves to $TEMP_DIR/rootfs/
cd "$TEMP_DIR" && docker compose up -d

# Stop and cleanup
cd "$TEMP_DIR" && docker compose down
rm -rf "$TEMP_DIR"
```

**Why temp dir:**
- Project directory stays clean
- Data isolated from source code
- Multiple instances possible
- Safe cleanup

**NEVER:**
- Run docker compose in project directory
- Run docker compose with `--project-directory` pointing to project root
- Mount volumes to `{project_root}/rootfs/`

### Port Mapping (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

| Mode | Format | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Development | `{randomport}:80` | `64580:80` |
| Production | `172.17.0.1:{randomport}:80` | `172.17.0.1:64580:80` |

**Rules:**
- Internal port is ALWAYS `80`
- External port is random unused port in `64xxx` range
- Production binds to Docker bridge IP (`172.17.0.1`) for security
- Development binds to all interfaces for easier access

### Environment Variables (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**ALL environment variables MUST be hardcoded with sane defaults. NEVER require .env files.**

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **NEVER** | Use `${VAR}` or `${VAR:-default}` syntax requiring .env |
| **NEVER** | Create `.env`, `.env.example`, `.env.sample` files |
| **ALWAYS** | Hardcode values directly in docker-compose.yml |
| **ALWAYS** | Use sane, working defaults |

**Why hardcoded defaults?**
- Works out of the box - no setup required
- No confusion about required variables
- No outdated .env.example files
- Users can override by editing docker-compose.yml directly

### Docker Compose Example (Development)

**Location:** `./docker/docker-compose.dev.yml`

```yaml
name: zipcodes

services:
  zipcodes:
    image: ghcr.io/apimgr/zipcodes:latest
    container_name: zipcodes
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      # Hardcoded with sane defaults - NO .env files
      - MODE=development
      - TZ=America/New_York
      - ENABLE_TOR=false
    ports:
      # Development: accessible from all interfaces
      - "64580:80"
    volumes:
      - ./rootfs/config/zipcodes:/config
      - ./rootfs/data/zipcodes:/data
    networks:
      - zipcodes

networks:
  zipcodes:
    name: zipcodes
    external: false
```

**Run:** Use temp directory workflow (see "Running Docker Compose" section above).

### Docker Compose Example (Production)

**Location:** `./docker/docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
name: zipcodes

services:
  zipcodes:
    image: ghcr.io/apimgr/zipcodes:latest
    container_name: zipcodes
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      # Hardcoded with sane defaults - NO .env files
      - MODE=production
      - TZ=America/New_York
      - ENABLE_TOR=true
    ports:
      # Production: bound to Docker bridge only
      - "172.17.0.1:64580:80"
    volumes:
      - ./rootfs/config/zipcodes:/config
      - ./rootfs/data/zipcodes:/data
    networks:
      - zipcodes

networks:
  zipcodes:
    name: zipcodes
    external: false
```

**Run:** Use temp directory workflow (see "Running Docker Compose" section above).

### Docker Compose with Database Example

**Location:** `./docker/docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
name: zipcodes

services:
  zipcodes:
    image: ghcr.io/apimgr/zipcodes:latest
    container_name: zipcodes
    restart: unless-stopped
    depends_on:
      - postgres
    environment:
      - MODE=production
      - TZ=America/New_York
      - ENABLE_TOR=true
      - DB_HOST=postgres
      - DB_PORT=5432
      - DB_NAME=zipcodes
      - DB_USER=zipcodes
      - DB_PASS=zipcodes
    ports:
      - "172.17.0.1:64580:80"
    volumes:
      - ./rootfs/config/zipcodes:/config
      - ./rootfs/data/zipcodes:/data
    networks:
      - zipcodes

  postgres:
    image: postgres:alpine
    container_name: zipcodes-postgres
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=zipcodes
      - POSTGRES_USER=zipcodes
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=zipcodes
      - TZ=America/New_York
    volumes:
      - ./rootfs/db/postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    networks:
      - zipcodes

networks:
  zipcodes:
    name: zipcodes
    external: false
```

**Run:** Use temp directory workflow (see "Running Docker Compose" section above).

## Container Configuration

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Internal port | **80** (always) |
| Config dir | `/config` |
| Data dir | `/data` |
| Database dir | `/data/db` (server.db, users.db) |
| Log dir | `/data/logs` |
| Tor data dir | `/data/tor` |
| GeoIP dir | `/data/geoip` |
| Backup dir | `/data/backup` |
| Binary | `/usr/local/bin/zipcodes` |
| HEALTHCHECK | `{binary} --status` |

**Path Mapping (Container vs Host):**

| Container Path | Host Path | Purpose |
|----------------|-----------|---------|
| `/config` | `./rootfs/config/{servicename}` | Configuration files |
| `/data` | `./rootfs/data/{servicename}` | All persistent data |
| `/data/db` | (inside /data) | SQLite databases |
| `/data/logs` | (inside /data) | Log files |

## Tor in Container

**Tor is included in the container image and managed by the application.**

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Auto-start | Application starts Tor automatically if enabled |
| Data persistence | Tor keys stored in `/data/tor/site/` (survives container restart) |
| .onion address | Persists across container restarts via volume mount |

## Container Detection

**Assume running in container if tini init system (PID 1) is detected.**

| When in Container | Behavior |
|-------------------|----------|
| Show setup token | On first run - one-time setup token displayed in console for `/admin` access |
| Defaults | Use container-appropriate defaults |
| Logging | Log to stdout/stderr (captured by container runtime) |
| Tor | Application manages Tor process internally |

## Image Tags (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Release Tags (Production)

| Tag | Description | Example |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| `ghcr.io/apimgr/zipcodes:latest` | Latest stable release | `ghcr.io/myorg/myapp:latest` |
| `ghcr.io/apimgr/zipcodes:{version}` | Specific version | `ghcr.io/myorg/myapp:1.2.3` |
| `ghcr.io/apimgr/zipcodes:{YYMM}` | Year/month tag | `ghcr.io/myorg/myapp:2512` |
| `ghcr.io/apimgr/zipcodes:{commit}` | Git commit (7 char) | `ghcr.io/myorg/myapp:abc1234` |

### Development Tags (Local)

| Tag | Description | Example |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| `zipcodes:dev` | Local development build | `myapp:dev` |
| `zipcodes:test` | Local test build | `myapp:test` |

### Registry

| Environment | Registry |
|-------------|----------|
| Release | `ghcr.io` (GitHub Container Registry) |
| Development | Local Docker daemon only |

### Tag Rules

1. **Release builds** MUST push to `ghcr.io/apimgr/zipcodes`
2. **Development builds** MUST use local-only tags (no registry prefix)
3. **NEVER push `:dev` or `:test` tags to ghcr.io**
4. All release images built for `linux/amd64` AND `linux/arm64`

---

# PART 20: MAKEFILE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Four targets only. DO NOT ADD MORE.**

## Targets

| Target | Description | Output |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| `build` | Build all platforms + host binary | `./binaries/` |
| `release` | GitHub release with source archive | `./releases/` |
| `docker` | Build and push container to ghcr.io | ghcr.io |
| `test` | Run all tests | - |

## Versioning (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Version File: `./release.txt`

- If `VERSION` env var is set, use it (highest priority)
- If `./release.txt` exists, read version from it
- If `./release.txt` does not exist, create with current app version
- Auto-increment patch version on each release
- Semantic versioning: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., `1.2.3`)

### Version Tag `v` Prefix Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Only add `v` prefix if BOTH conditions are met:**
1. Tag does NOT already start with `v`
2. Tag IS a semantic version (matches `X.Y.Z` pattern)

| Tag Input | Is Semver? | Has `v`? | Display As |
|-----------|------------|----------|------------|
| `1.2.0` | ✓ | ✗ | `v1.2.0` |
| `v1.2.0` | ✓ | ✓ | `v1.2.0` |
| `1.2.3-rc1` | ✓ | ✗ | `v1.2.3-rc1` |
| `dev` | ✗ | - | `dev` |
| `beta` | ✗ | - | `beta` |
| `daily` | ✗ | - | `daily` |
| `20251218060432` | ✗ | - | `20251218060432` |
| `20251218060432-beta` | ✗ | - | `20251218060432-beta` |

```bash
# Shell function to format version tag
format_version_tag() {
    local tag="$1"
    # Check if already starts with v
    if [[ "$tag" == v* ]]; then
        echo "$tag"
        return
    fi
    # Check if it's a semantic version (X.Y.Z with optional suffix)
    if [[ "$tag" =~ ^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+ ]]; then
        echo "v$tag"
    else
        echo "$tag"
    fi
}
```

### Version Priority

1. `VERSION` environment variable (if set)
2. `./release.txt` file (if exists)
3. Create `./release.txt` with `0.1.0` (first release)

## Binary Naming (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

| Context | Name | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| Host Build | `./binaries/zipcodes` | `./binaries/jokes` |
| Distribution | `zipcodes-{os}-{arch}` | `jokes-linux-amd64` |
| Local/Testing | `/tmp/apimgr-build/zipcodes/zipcodes` | - |

**If built with musl → strip binary before release. Final name has NO `-musl` suffix.**

## Build Matrix

| OS | Architectures |
|----|---------------|
| Linux | amd64, arm64 |
| macOS (Darwin) | amd64, arm64 |
| Windows | amd64, arm64 |
| FreeBSD | amd64, arm64 |

## Makefile Implementation

```makefile
PROJECT := zipcodes
ORG := apimgr

# Version: env var > release.txt > default
VERSION ?= $(shell cat release.txt 2>/dev/null || echo "0.1.0")

# Build info - use TZ env var or system timezone

## Embedded Build Info (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Every binary MUST have these values embedded at build time:

| Variable | Example | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `Version` | `1.2.3` | Semantic version from release.txt |
| `CommitID` | `a1b2c3d` | Git short commit hash |
| `BuildDate` | `Thu Dec 17, 2025 at 18:19:24 EST` | Build timestamp with timezone |

**Go code requirement** (in `main.go` or `version.go`):

```go
// Build info - set via -ldflags at build time
var (
    Version   = "dev"
    CommitID  = "unknown"
    BuildDate = "unknown"
)
```

**Build date format:** Uses build system timezone or `TZ` env var.

## Go Module Caching

All Docker builds use persistent Go module caching to avoid re-downloading dependencies:

| Cache | Host Path | Container Path |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| Build cache | `~/.cache/go-build` | `/root/.cache/go-build` |
| Module cache | `~/go/pkg/mod` | `/go/pkg/mod` |

**Benefits:**
- First build downloads modules once
- Subsequent builds use cached modules
- Shared across all projects on the same machine
- Significantly faster builds after first run

## Target Details

### `make build`

1. Creates cache directories if needed
2. Downloads Go modules (cached)
3. Creates `./binaries/` directory
4. Builds host binary: `./binaries/zipcodes`
5. Builds all platform binaries: `./binaries/zipcodes-{os}-{arch}`
6. Uses `CGO_ENABLED=0` for static binaries
7. Embeds Version, CommitID, BuildDate via `-ldflags`
8. All builds via Docker (`golang:alpine`)

### `make release`

1. Runs `build` first
2. Creates `releases/version.txt` with current version
3. Strips binaries (removes symbols)
4. Creates source archive (excludes `.git`, `.github`, `.gitea`, `binaries/`, `releases/`)
5. Deletes existing GitHub release/tag if exists
6. Creates new GitHub release marked as `--latest`
7. Uses `gh` CLI - **manual local release only**

### `make docker`

1. Downloads Go modules (cached)
2. Builds Linux binaries to `./binaries/` (amd64 and arm64)
3. Uses `docker buildx` for multi-arch builds
4. Context is project root, Dockerfile at `./docker/Dockerfile`
5. Builds for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`
6. Pushes to `ghcr.io/{org}/zipcodes:{version}` and `:latest`
7. Passes VERSION, BUILD_DATE, VCS_REF as build args

### `make test`

1. Downloads Go modules (cached)
2. Runs tests inside Docker container (`golang:alpine`)
3. Mounts project directory to `/build`
4. Runs `go test` with coverage
5. Tests all packages (`./...`)
6. Container removed after completion (`--rm`)

## Directory Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **NEVER symlink** | Never symlink between `binaries/` and `releases/` |
| **NEVER copy** | Never copy files between `binaries/` and `releases/` |
| **binaries/** | Build output only - temporary, gitignored |
| **releases/** | Release artifacts only - packaged for distribution |
| **version.txt** | Every release includes `version.txt` with current version |

## Release Types

### Stable Release

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Trigger | Git tag push (`v*`, `*.*.*`) |
| Version format | Semantic (`X.Y.Z`) |
| Release name | `{tag}` or `v{tag}` if semver without `v` (see v prefix rules) |
| version.txt | `{version}` (without `v` prefix) |
| GitHub release | Yes, marked as latest |

### Beta Release

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Trigger | Push to `beta` branch |
| Version format | `{YYYYMMDDHHMMSS}-beta` (e.g., `20251205143022-beta`) |
| Release name | `{YYYYMMDDHHMMSS}-beta` |
| version.txt | `{YYYYMMDDHHMMSS}-beta` |
| GitHub release | Yes, marked as pre-release |

### Daily Build

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Trigger | Daily schedule (3am UTC) + push to main/master |
| Version format | `{YYYYMMDDHHMMSS}` (e.g., `20251218060432`) |
| Release name | `daily` (single rolling release) |
| version.txt | `{YYYYMMDDHHMMSS}` |
| GitHub release | Yes, **replaces previous daily** |
| Max releases | **1** (always overwrites previous daily) |

**Daily Build Rules:**
- Only ONE daily release exists at any time
- Each daily build **deletes and replaces** the previous `daily` release
- Prevents accumulation of thousands of releases
- Users always get the latest daily build

## Version Files

| File | Purpose | When Updated |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `release.txt` | Source of truth for stable version | Manual |
| `releases/version.txt` | Included in release archive | During release build |

## Release Summary

| Type | Method | Version Example | Max Releases |
|------|--------|-----------------|--------------|
| Stable | GitHub Actions (tag) or `make release` (local) | `1.2.3` | Unlimited |
| Beta | GitHub Actions only | `20251205143022-beta` | Unlimited |
| Daily | GitHub Actions only | `20251218060432` | **1** (rolling) |

**Note:** `make release` is for manual local releases only. All automated releases use GitHub Actions.

---

# PART 21: GITHUB ACTIONS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**All projects MUST have GitHub Actions workflows.**

## Workflow Files

| File | Trigger | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `release.yml` | Tag push (`v*`, `*.*.*`) | Production releases |
| `beta.yml` | Push to `beta` branch | Beta releases |
| `daily.yml` | Daily at 3am UTC + push to main/master | Daily builds |
| `docker.yml` | Version tag, push to main/master/beta | Docker images |

## Build Info Variables

All workflows MUST set these environment variables:

```yaml
env:
  VERSION: ${{ github.ref_name }}  # or from release.txt
  COMMIT_ID: ${{ github.sha }}
  BUILD_DATE: $(date +"%a %b %d, %Y at %H:%M:%S %Z")
  LDFLAGS: "-s -w -X 'main.Version=${{ env.VERSION }}' -X 'main.CommitID=${{ env.COMMIT_ID }}' -X 'main.BuildDate=${{ env.BUILD_DATE }}'"
```

## Docker Workflow

### Triggers and Tags

| Trigger | Image Tags |
|---------|------------|
| Version tag | `{version}`, `latest`, `YYMM`, `{GIT_COMMIT}` |
| Push to main/master | `dev`, `{GIT_COMMIT}` |
| Push to beta | `beta`, `{GIT_COMMIT}` |

**Notes:**
- `{GIT_COMMIT}` = short SHA (7 characters)
- `YYMM` = year/month (e.g., `2512`)
- Built for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` using `docker buildx`
- Registry: `ghcr.io`

# GITEA ACTIONS (Alternative to GitHub)

**For projects hosted on Gitea, use these equivalent workflows.**

Gitea Actions use nearly identical syntax to GitHub Actions. Key differences:
- Directory: `.gitea/workflows/` instead of `.github/workflows/`
- Use `gitea.com/actions/*` actions or compatible alternatives
- Registry: Use Gitea's container registry or specify external registry
- Some GitHub-specific variables have Gitea equivalents

## Workflow Files

| File | Trigger | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `release.yml` | Tag push (`v*`, `*.*.*`) | Production releases |
| `beta.yml` | Push to `beta` branch | Beta releases |
| `daily.yml` | Daily at 3am UTC + push to main/master | Daily builds |
| `docker.yml` | Version tag, push to main/master/beta | Docker images |

## Release Workflow (Stable)

## Gitea vs GitHub Variable Mapping

| GitHub | Gitea | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `${{ github.* }}` | `${{ gitea.* }}` | Context variables |
| `GITHUB_ENV` | `GITEA_ENV` | Environment file |
| `GITHUB_OUTPUT` | `GITEA_OUTPUT` | Output file |
| `GITHUB_REF_NAME` | `GITEA_REF_NAME` | Reference name |
| `github.token` | `secrets.GITEA_TOKEN` | Auth token |
| `github.actor` | `gitea.actor` | Username |
| `github.repository` | `gitea.repository` | Repo path |
| `github.server_url` | `gitea.server_url` | Server URL |

**Notes:**
- Most GitHub Actions work on Gitea with minimal changes
- Use `secrets.GITEA_TOKEN` for authentication (create in Gitea settings)
- Container registry URL depends on Gitea instance configuration
- Some advanced GitHub features may not be available

## Jenkins (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Configuration

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Server | `jenkins.casjay.cc` |
| Agents | `arm64`, `amd64` |
| Build | Both architectures in parallel |
| Trigger | Push to main/master, tags, PRs |

---

# CHECKPOINT 6: BUILD & DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION

Before proceeding, confirm you understand:
- [ ] Docker uses tini as init, Alpine base
- [ ] Makefile has exactly 4 targets: build, release, docker, test
- [ ] Binary naming: NEVER include -musl suffix
- [ ] 4 GitHub/Gitea workflows: release, beta, daily, docker
- [ ] Jenkins builds for ARM64 and AMD64
- [ ] All 8 platform builds required (4 OS x 2 arch)

---

# PART 22: BINARY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

## Single Static Binary

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Type | **SINGLE STATIC BINARY** |
| Assets | Embedded using Go's `embed` package |
| Dependencies | None at runtime |
| Build | **CGO_ENABLED=0** |
| Libraries | Pure Go only (no CGO) |

## Default Behavior

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| No arguments | Initialize (if needed) and start server |
| First run | Auto-create config with defaults |
| First run | Auto-create required directories |
| Signals | Proper handling (SIGTERM, SIGINT, SIGHUP) |
| PID file | Enabled by default |

## Embedded Assets

| Asset Type | Location |
|------------|----------|
| Templates | `src/server/templates/` |
| Static files | `src/server/static/` |
| Application data | `src/data/` (JSON files) |

## External Data (NOT Embedded)

| Data Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| GeoIP databases | Download, update via scheduler |
| Blocklists | Download, update via scheduler |
| Security databases | Any security-related data |

---

# PART 23: TESTING & DEVELOPMENT (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

## NEVER Use Project Directory for Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**ALL testing, debugging, and runtime data MUST use temp directories. NEVER the project directory.**

| FORBIDDEN | REASON |
|-----------|--------|
| `./data/` | Project directory - will pollute repo |
| `./config/` | Project directory - will pollute repo |
| `./test-data/` | Project directory - will pollute repo |
| `./logs/` | Project directory - will pollute repo |
| `{project_path}/anything` | NEVER write test data to project |

**The project directory is for SOURCE CODE ONLY. All runtime/test data goes to `/tmp/`.**

## NEVER Create Example Files (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Do NOT create example/sample configuration files in the repository.**

| FORBIDDEN | REASON |
|-----------|--------|
| `server.example.yml` | Unnecessary - defaults are in binary |
| `server.sample.yml` | Unnecessary - defaults are in binary |
| `.env` | We don't use .env files |
| `.env.example` | We don't use .env files |
| `.env.sample` | We don't use .env files |
| `.env.local` | We don't use .env files |
| `config.example.json` | Unnecessary |
| `*.example.*` | No example files of any kind |
| `*.sample.*` | No sample files of any kind |

**If docker-compose.yml needs env vars → hardcode with sane defaults. NEVER use .env files.**

**Why no example files?**

| Reason | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Self-documenting** | Binary generates default config on first run |
| **Always current** | Embedded defaults are always in sync with code |
| **No maintenance** | Example files become outdated and misleading |
| **Cleaner repo** | Less clutter in repository |

**How users get configuration:**

1. Run binary - it auto-generates `server.yml` with defaults on first run
2. Admin panel shows all settings with descriptions
3. Documentation in AI.md describes all options

## Temporary Directory Structure (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Format:** `/tmp/{orgname}-{purpose}/zipcodes/`

| Purpose | Path | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| Build output | `/tmp/apimgr-build/zipcodes/` | `/tmp/apimgr-build/jokes/` |
| Test config | `/tmp/apimgr-test/zipcodes/config/` | `/tmp/apimgr-test/jokes/config/` |
| Test data | `/tmp/apimgr-test/zipcodes/data/` | `/tmp/apimgr-test/jokes/data/` |
| Test logs | `/tmp/apimgr-test/zipcodes/logs/` | `/tmp/apimgr-test/jokes/logs/` |
| Debug files | `/tmp/apimgr-debug/zipcodes/` | `/tmp/apimgr-debug/jokes/` |
| Runtime temp | `/tmp/apimgr-runtime/zipcodes/` | `/tmp/apimgr-runtime/jokes/` |

### Rules

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **NEVER** | Use project directory for test/runtime data |
| **NEVER** | Use `/tmp/zipcodes` directly |
| **NEVER** | Use `/tmp/` root for project files |
| **ALWAYS** | Use `/tmp/{orgname}-{purpose}/zipcodes/` format |
| **ALWAYS** | Include organization prefix to avoid conflicts |
| **ALWAYS** | Include purpose subdirectory for organization |

### Why This Structure?

| Reason | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Avoid conflicts** | Multiple projects/orgs won't collide |
| **Easy cleanup** | `rm -rf /tmp/apimgr-*` cleans all org temp files |
| **Clear purpose** | Directory name shows what files are for |
| **Debugging** | Easy to find specific project's temp files |

### Correct vs Incorrect

| WRONG | RIGHT |
|-------|-------|
| `/tmp/jokes` | `/tmp/apimgr-build/jokes/` |
| `/tmp/build/jokes` | `/tmp/apimgr-build/jokes/` |
| `/tmp/test` | `/tmp/apimgr-test/jokes/` |
| `/tmp/jokes-test` | `/tmp/apimgr-test/jokes/` |

## Container Usage (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**ALL builds, tests, and debugging MUST use Docker containers. NEVER build directly on the host system.**

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Build environment | Docker (preferred), Incus, or LXD |
| Go Image | **`golang:alpine`** (Alpine-based, latest) |
| Runtime Image | **`alpine:latest`** |
| Test binaries | Temp directories only |
| **NEVER** | Run `go build` directly on host |
| **NEVER** | Install Go on host system |
| **ALWAYS** | Use containerized build command below |

### Why Containerized Builds?

| Reason | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Clean system** | No Go installation, no build artifacts on host |
| **Cross-platform** | Works on any distro/platform with Docker |
| **Consistent environment** | Same Go version and dependencies across all builds |
| **Static binaries** | `CGO_ENABLED=0` produces binaries with no runtime dependencies |
| **Reproducible** | Builds work regardless of host OS setup |
| **No pollution** | Host system stays clean |

### Container Images

| Purpose | Image | Why |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Building Go | `golang:alpine` | Latest Go on Alpine, small image |
| Runtime | `alpine:latest` | Minimal runtime with curl, bash, tini |
| Testing | `golang:alpine` | Same as build for consistency |

## Build Command (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**This is the REQUIRED build command. Not an example - this MUST be used.**

```bash
docker run --rm -v /path/to/project:/build -w /build -e CGO_ENABLED=0 \
  golang:alpine go build -o /tmp/apimgr-build/zipcodes/zipcodes ./src
```

### Testing a Built Binary

```bash
# Build
docker run --rm -v /root/Projects/github/apimgr/zipcodes:/build -w /build \
  -e CGO_ENABLED=0 golang:alpine go build -o /tmp/apimgr-build/zipcodes/zipcodes ./src

# Basic tests (no config needed)
/tmp/apimgr-build/zipcodes/zipcodes --help
/tmp/apimgr-build/zipcodes/zipcodes --version

# Full test with config/data (ALWAYS use temp directories)
mkdir -p /tmp/apimgr-test/zipcodes/{config,data,logs}

# Run with temp directories (use correct CLI flags)
/tmp/apimgr-build/zipcodes/zipcodes \
  --config /tmp/apimgr-test/zipcodes/config \
  --data /tmp/apimgr-test/zipcodes/data

# Cleanup after testing
rm -rf /tmp/apimgr-test/zipcodes
rm -rf /tmp/apimgr-build/zipcodes
```

### Test Directory Setup

**ALWAYS create temp directories before running tests:**

```bash
# Create all test directories
TEST_BASE="/tmp/apimgr-test/zipcodes"
mkdir -p "$TEST_BASE"/{config,data/db,data/tor,data/geoip,logs}

# Run binary with test directories (use correct CLI flags)
/tmp/apimgr-build/zipcodes/zipcodes \
  --config "$TEST_BASE/config" \
  --data "$TEST_BASE/data"
```

**NEVER run the binary without specifying temp directories - it may default to project directory!**

## Process Management (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**STRICT RULES: Only kill/remove the EXACT process or container being worked on. NEVER anything else.**

### FORBIDDEN Commands (NEVER Use)

| Command | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| `pkill -f {pattern}` | Too broad, kills unrelated processes |
| `pkill {name}` | Too broad without `-x` flag |
| `killall {name}` | Too broad, may kill unrelated processes |
| `kill -9 {pid}` | Use graceful `kill {pid}` first |
| `docker kill` | Use `docker stop` for graceful shutdown |
| `docker rm $(docker ps -aq)` | Removes ALL containers |
| `docker rm $(docker ps -q)` | Removes ALL running containers |
| `docker rmi $(docker images -q)` | Removes ALL images |
| `docker system prune` | Cleans ALL unused resources |
| `docker container prune` | Removes ALL stopped containers |
| `docker image prune` | Removes ALL dangling images |
| `docker volume prune` | Removes ALL unused volumes |
| `docker network prune` | Removes ALL unused networks |
| `rm -rf /` | Catastrophic |
| `rm -rf /*` | Catastrophic |
| `rm -rf ~` | Destroys home directory |
| `rm -rf .` | Dangerous in wrong directory |
| `rm -rf *` | Dangerous without proper scoping |

### Process Termination Rules

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Identify first** | ALWAYS get exact PID before killing |
| **Graceful first** | Use `kill {pid}` (SIGTERM), wait, then `kill -9 {pid}` only if needed |
| **One at a time** | Kill ONE specific PID, never patterns |
| **Verify PID** | Confirm PID belongs to the project process |
| **Document** | Log what was killed and why |

**Kill Process Flow:**
```
1. pgrep -la zipcodes           # List matching processes
2. Verify the PID is correct          # CHECK before killing
3. kill {pid}                         # Graceful termination (SIGTERM)
4. sleep 5                            # Wait for graceful shutdown
5. pgrep -la zipcodes           # Check if still running
6. kill -9 {pid}                      # Force kill ONLY if still running
```

### Docker Container Rules

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **ONLY this project** | Only stop/remove containers named `zipcodes` |
| **NEVER other containers** | Even if they look related or unused |
| **NEVER images not ours** | Only remove `apimgr/zipcodes:*` images |
| **NEVER base images** | Never remove `golang`, `alpine`, `ubuntu`, etc. |
| **NEVER volumes** | Unless explicitly part of this project |

**Docker Cleanup Flow:**
```
1. docker ps -a --filter name=zipcodes     # List ONLY this project's containers
2. Verify output shows ONLY zipcodes       # CHECK before removing
3. docker stop zipcodes                    # Stop gracefully
4. docker rm zipcodes                      # Remove container

# For images:
1. docker images apimgr/zipcodes     # List ONLY this project's images
2. Verify output shows ONLY our images          # CHECK before removing
3. docker rmi apimgr/zipcodes:tag    # Remove SPECIFIC tag
```

### Allowed Commands (Project-Scoped ONLY)

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `kill {specific-pid}` | Kill exact PID only (after verification) |
| `pkill -x zipcodes` | Exact binary name match only |
| `docker stop zipcodes` | Stop specific container by name |
| `docker rm zipcodes` | Remove specific container by name |
| `docker rmi apimgr/zipcodes:tag` | Remove specific image:tag |
| `rm -rf /tmp/apimgr-build/zipcodes/` | Remove specific project temp files |
| `rm -rf /tmp/apimgr-*/zipcodes/` | Remove all temp files for one project |

### Before ANY Kill/Remove Operation

1. **List first**: See exactly what will be affected
2. **Verify**: Confirm it's the correct process/container/file
3. **Be specific**: Use exact names, PIDs, or paths - NEVER patterns
4. **Ask if unsure**: When in doubt, ask the user
5. **Document**: Log what was removed and why

## File Cleanup Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Always be explicit and project-scoped when deleting files.**

### Safe Cleanup Commands

| Purpose | Command |
|---------|---------|
| Project build temp | `rm -rf /tmp/apimgr-build/zipcodes/` |
| Project test temp | `rm -rf /tmp/apimgr-test/zipcodes/` |
| Project debug temp | `rm -rf /tmp/apimgr-debug/zipcodes/` |
| All project temp | `rm -rf /tmp/apimgr-*/zipcodes/` |
| All org temp | `rm -rf /tmp/apimgr-*/` |
| Project binaries | `rm -rf ./binaries/zipcodes*` |
| Project releases | `rm -rf ./releases/zipcodes*` |

### NEVER Delete Without Confirmation

| Item | Why |
|------|-----|
| User data directories | Irreversible data loss |
| Config files | User customizations lost |
| Database files | Data loss |
| SSL certificates | Service disruption |
| Git repositories | Code loss |
| Anything outside project scope | Affects other systems |

### Cleanup Checklist

Before running any `rm -rf`:

1. **Echo first**: `echo "Would delete: /path/to/delete"` - verify the path
2. **Check pwd**: `pwd` - make sure you're in the right directory
3. **List first**: `ls -la /path/to/delete` - see what will be deleted
4. **Be specific**: Use full paths, not relative paths with wildcards
5. **Ask if unsure**: When in doubt, ask the user before deleting

### Log Output Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**All log FILES MUST use raw text only:**
- NO emojis
- NO ANSI color codes
- NO special characters or formatting
- Plain ASCII text only
- Machine-parseable format

**Console output (stdout/stderr) CAN be pretty:**
- Emojis allowed (e.g., `✅ Server started`, `❌ Error`, `⚠️ Warning`)
- ANSI colors allowed
- Pretty formatting allowed
- Used for start/stop/restart/status messages
- User-facing CLI output can be visually appealing

**Rule:** Log files = raw/plain text. Console = pretty is OK.

### Log Rotation

**Defaults:**
| Log Type | Rotation | Keep |
|----------|----------|------|
| access.log | monthly | none |
| All others | weekly,50MB | none |

**Rules:**
- `weekly,50MB` = rotate on weekly OR 50MB, whichever comes first
- `keep: none` = do not retain old logs (default)
- Built-in rotation support (no external logrotate needed)
- Old logs deleted immediately after rotation (default)
- Optional: compress before delete, retain with `keep: weekly:N` or `monthly:N`

  logging:
    audit:
      enabled: true
      file: "{log_dir}/audit.log"
      format: "json"           # json only (text not supported for audit)

      # Rotation
      rotate: "daily"          # daily, size, none
      max_size: "100MB"        # Max size before rotation (if rotate: size)
      keep: 0                  # Days to retain (0 = delete on rotation, default)
      compress: false          # Compress rotated logs (only if keep > 0)

      # What to log
      events:
        authentication: true   # Login/logout events
        configuration: true    # Config changes
        security: true         # Security events
        tokens: true           # Token create/revoke

## Sane Defaults

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `true` | Audit logging enabled |
| `format` | `json` | JSON format (required) |
| `rotate` | `daily` | Rotate daily |
| `keep` | `0` | Delete on rotation (no old logs kept) |
| `compress` | `false` | No compression (deleted immediately) |
| `mask_emails` | `true` | Mask email addresses |
| All event categories | `true` | Log all events |
| `token_usage` | `false` | Don't log every token use |

**Why `keep: 0` by default?**
- Reduces disk usage
- Minimizes data retention liability
- Users who need log history can configure retention
- Current log always available until rotation

## Audit Log Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**NEVER Log:**
- ❌ Passwords (plain, hashed, or encrypted)
- ❌ API tokens or secrets (full value)
- ❌ Session tokens (full value)

- ❌ Credit card numbers
- ❌ Full email addresses (mask them)

**ALWAYS Log:**
- ✓ Timestamp in UTC with milliseconds
- ✓ IP address for all events
- ✓ Actor identity (who did it)
- ✓ Event result (success/failure)
- ✓ Unique event ID

**Token/ID Masking:**
- Show only first 8 characters: `token_abc12345...`
- Or use separate ID field that doesn't expose token value

## Admin Panel (`/admin/server/logs/audit`)

| Element | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Log viewer | Table | Paginated audit log entries |
| Filters | Dropdowns | Filter by category, severity, date range |

- Note: Export respects same masking rules as display

## Audit Log Integrity

**The audit log is append-only and tamper-evident.**

| Protection | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Append-only | Application can only append, never modify or delete entries |
| No truncate | Application cannot truncate the log file |
| Rotation only | Only log rotation can remove old entries |
| Checksum | Optional: Include running checksum for tamper detection |

**File Permissions:**
```

# PART 26: BACKUP & RESTORE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

## Backup Command

```bash
zipcodes --maintenance backup [filename]
```

### Backup Contents

| Content | Included | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| `server.yml` | ✓ Always | Configuration file |
| `server.db` | ✓ Always | Main database (admin credentials, settings) |
| `users.db` | ✓ If exists | User database (multi-user mode) |
| `{config_dir}/templates/` | ✓ If exists | Custom email templates |
| `{config_dir}/themes/` | ✓ If exists | Custom themes |
| `{config_dir}/ssl/` | Optional | SSL certificates (flag: `--include-ssl`) |
| `{data_dir}/` | Optional | Data files (flag: `--include-data`) |

### Admin Credentials in Backup

**Yes, admin credentials are included in the backup (`server.db`).**

| Credential | Included | Format |
|------------|----------|--------|
| Admin username | ✓ | Plain text |
| Admin password | ✓ | Hashed (bcrypt) |
| Admin API token | ✓ | Hashed |
| Admin 2FA secret | ✓ | Encrypted |
| Admin recovery keys | ✓ | Hashed |
| Additional admin accounts | ✓ | Same as above |
| OIDC/LDAP admin mappings | ✓ | Configuration only |

### Backup Format

- Single `.tar.gz` file
- Filename: `zipcodes_backup_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.tar.gz`
- Includes manifest with version info
- Encrypted option available (`--encrypt`)

**Manifest (`manifest.json`):**
```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "created_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "created_by": "administrator",
  "app_version": "1.2.3",
  "contents": [
    "server.yml",
    "server.db",
    "users.db",
    "templates/",
    "ssl/"
  ],
  "encrypted": false,
  "checksum": "sha256:abc123..."
}
```

## Restore Command

```bash
zipcodes --maintenance restore <backup-file>
```

### Restore Behavior

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| **Restore to same server** | Overwrites current config and database |
| **Restore to new server** | Primary admin must re-authenticate |
| **Version mismatch** | Warning shown, migrations applied if needed |

### Primary Admin Re-Setup on Restore

**When restoring a backup to a NEW server, the primary admin must re-authenticate:**

```
Restore completed. Primary admin re-authentication required.

A new setup token has been generated:

  Setup Token: abc123-xyz789-setup-token

Go to: https://{host}:{port}/admin

Enter the setup token to verify you are the server administrator.
Your existing password and settings will be preserved.
```

**Why Re-Authentication?**
- Prevents stolen backup from granting immediate admin access
- Verifies person restoring has server-level access (can see console)
- Preserves existing admin credentials (just requires re-verification)

**What is Preserved:**
- Admin username
- Admin password (still valid after re-auth)
- Admin 2FA settings
- Admin API token
- All configuration
- All user accounts

**What Requires Re-Setup:**
- Initial setup token verification (one-time)

### Additional Admins on Restore

| Admin Type | Restore Behavior |
|------------|------------------|
| **Primary Admin** | Must re-authenticate with setup token |
| **Additional Admins (local)** | Can log in immediately with existing credentials |
| **OIDC/LDAP Admins** | Can log in if OIDC/LDAP provider accessible |

## Admin Recovery Command

```bash
zipcodes --maintenance setup
```

**Purpose:** Resets admin credentials and generates a new setup token. This is the ONLY way for a server admin to recover access if they have lost their password, API token, AND recovery keys.

### What It Does

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Clears admin password** | Admin password is set to null/empty |
| **Clears admin API token** | Admin API token is invalidated |
| **Generates new setup token** | One-time setup token displayed in console |
| **Preserves everything else** | User accounts, data, configuration unchanged |

### What It Does NOT Do

| Preserved | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **User accounts** | All user accounts remain intact |
| **User passwords** | No user credentials are modified |
| **User data** | All user data is preserved |
| **Configuration** | All settings except admin credentials |
| **Database** | No data is deleted or modified |
| **SSL certificates** | Certificates remain valid |

### Usage

```bash
# Stop the service first (recommended)
zipcodes --service stop

# Run setup reset
zipcodes --maintenance setup

# Output:
# ╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
# ║                     ADMIN CREDENTIALS RESET                      ║
# ╠══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
# ║  Admin password and API token have been cleared.                 ║
# ║                                                                  ║
# ║  NEW SETUP TOKEN (copy this now, shown ONCE):                    ║

# ║  │  setup_a7b9c2d4e6f8g0h1i3j5k7l9m1n3o5p7                    │  ║
# ║  └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘  ║
# ║                                                                  ║
# ║  1. Start the service: zipcodes --service start             ║
# ║  2. Go to: http://{host}:{port}/admin                            ║
# ║  3. Enter the setup token above                                  ║
# ║  4. Create new admin account via setup wizard                    ║
# ╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

# Start the service
zipcodes --service start
```

### Security Considerations

| Consideration | Requirement |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Requires root/admin** | Must have system-level access to run binary |
| **Console access required** | Setup token only displayed in terminal |
| **One-time token** | Token expires after use or after 24 hours |
| **Logged** | Action logged to audit log (if available) |
| **Service should be stopped** | Recommended to stop service first |

### When to Use

| Scenario | Use `--maintenance setup` |
|----------|---------------------------|
| Admin forgot password | ✓ Yes |
| Admin lost API token | ✓ Yes |
| Admin lost recovery keys | ✓ Yes |
| Admin locked out of 2FA | ✓ Yes (only if no recovery keys) |
| User forgot password | ✗ No (use password reset) |
| User locked out | ✗ No (admin can help via UI) |
| Routine password change | ✗ No (use /admin/profile) |

# PART 31: USER MANAGEMENT (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

## Overview

**Projects can operate in two modes: admin-only or multi-user.**

| Mode | Use Case | Default |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Admin-only** | Simple APIs (jokes, quotes, etc.) - just admin account | YES |
| **Multi-user** | Apps needing user accounts, registration, profiles, API tokens | NO |

## Server Admin vs Regular Users (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Server admins are SYSTEM ACCOUNTS responsible for managing the application itself. Regular users are end-users of the application.**

### Key Distinction

| Aspect | Server Admin | Regular User |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| **Purpose** | Manage server, configuration, other users | Use the application features |
| **Scope** | System-wide administration | Own account and data only |
| **Storage** | `admin_credentials` table | `users` table |
| **Login** | `/auth/login` → `/admin/*` | `/auth/login` → `/user/*` |
| **Access** | Admin panel (`/admin/*`) | User routes (`/user/*`) |
| **Created by** | Setup wizard, existing admin, or OIDC/LDAP group mapping | Registration or admin invitation |

### Account Types Summary

| Account Type | Storage | Login | Access |
|--------------|---------|-------|--------|
| **Server Admin** | Database (`admin_credentials` table) | `/auth/login` | `/admin/*` only |
| **Regular Users** | Database (`users` table) | `/auth/login` | `/user/*` routes |

**Important:** Server admins and regular users are completely separate account types. A server admin is NOT a "privileged user" - they are a different kind of account entirely.

### Server Admin Behavior

| Route | Server Admin Access |
|-------|---------------------|
| `/admin/*` | Full access |
| `/user/*` | NO - treated as guest (redirect to `/admin`) |
| `/auth/login` | Login page |
| `/auth/logout` | Logout |
| Public routes (`/`, `/server/*`, etc.) | Guest view (no user-specific content) |

**Server Admin Setup (Setup Wizard Flow):**

**IMPORTANT: App works perfectly with sane defaults before setup.** Setup wizard is optional and allows customization. Server is fully functional immediately on first run.

### First Run Experience (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**On first run, the application:**

1. Creates default `server.yml` with sane defaults
2. Creates empty `server.db` database
3. Auto-detects and configures SMTP (if available)
4. Selects random available port (64xxx range)
5. Generates one-time setup token
6. Displays startup information in console
7. **Starts serving immediately** - fully functional

**Console Output (First Run):**

╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

[INFO] Server started successfully
[INFO] Listening on 0.0.0.0:64521
[INFO] SMTP auto-detected: localhost:25 (enabled)
```

**If SMTP Not Detected:**

```
║   📧 SMTP: Not detected (email features disabled)                     ║
║      Configure manually at /admin/server/email                       ║
```

### SMTP Auto-Detection (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**On first run, the application attempts to auto-detect a local SMTP server.**

| Check | Hosts | Ports |
|-------|-------|-------|
| 1 | `localhost` | 25, 587, 465 |
| 2 | `127.0.0.1` | 25, 587, 465 |
| 3 | `172.17.0.1` (Docker host) | 25, 587, 465 |
| 4 | Gateway IP | 25, 587, 465 |

**Auto-Detection Process:**
1. Try each host/port combination
2. Attempt SMTP handshake (EHLO)
3. First successful connection is used
4. Save to `server.yml` and enable email features
5. If all fail → email features disabled (not an error)

**Auto-Detected SMTP Config:**
```yaml
server:
  notifications:
    email:
      enabled: true          # Auto-enabled if detected
      autodetect: true       # Keep trying on restart if currently failed
      smtp:
        host: "localhost"    # Auto-detected
        port: 25             # Auto-detected
        username: ""         # Usually not needed for local
        password: ""
        tls: auto            # Auto-negotiate
```

**SMTP Auto-Detection Rules:**
- Only runs on first start (or if `autodetect: true` and no working SMTP)
- Does NOT override manually configured SMTP
- Silent failure - app works fine without SMTP
- Success enables all email features automatically
- Logged to console and audit log

### App Usability Before Setup

**The app is FULLY FUNCTIONAL before completing the setup wizard.**

| Feature | Available Before Setup? |
|---------|------------------------|
| Public API endpoints | ✓ Yes |
| Public web pages | ✓ Yes |
| Health checks (`/healthz`) | ✓ Yes |
| OpenAPI docs (`/openapi`) | ✓ Yes |
| GraphQL (if applicable) | ✓ Yes |
| Admin panel (`/admin`) | ✓ Yes (requires setup token) |
| Email features | ✓ Yes (if SMTP auto-detected) |
| Scheduled tasks | ✓ Yes (with defaults) |

**What Setup Wizard Provides:**
- Custom admin username/password (instead of generated)
- Customize server name/branding
- Configure optional features (Tor, SSL, multi-user)
- Receive API token for programmatic access

**Why This Matters:**
- Zero-config deployment works immediately
- Docker containers start serving instantly
- Setup can be done later at convenience
- CI/CD pipelines don't need interactive setup

### Setup Flow

On first run, a one-time setup token is generated and displayed in console. Admin setup follows this flow:

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Server generates one-time setup token (displayed in console ONCE) |
| 2 | User navigates to `/admin` |
| 3 | User enters setup token |
| 4 | Redirect to `/admin/server/setup` (setup wizard) |

**Setup Wizard Steps (`/admin/server/setup`):**

**Step 1: Create Admin Account**
| Field | Default | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Username | `administrator` | Changeable to anything (username blacklist does NOT apply to admin) |
| Password | Random (generated) | User MUST copy, OR can enter custom + confirm |

**Step 2: API Token**
| Action | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| Auto-generate API token | User MUST copy (shown once) |
| Token is tied to admin account | Used for API access |

**Step 3: Server Configuration**
| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Server name | Display name for the instance |
| Domain/FQDN | Primary domain (if known) |
| Mode | Production / Development |
| Timezone | Server timezone |

**Step 4: Optional Services**
| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Enable Tor | Enable .onion hidden service |
| Enable SSL | Configure HTTPS |
| Enable Users | Enable multi-user mode |

**Step 5: Complete**
| Action | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| Save configuration | Write to `server.yml` |
| Mark setup complete | Setup token invalidated |
| Redirect to `/admin` | Logged in as admin |

**Setup Token Rules:**
- Generated on first run ONLY
- Displayed in console ONCE (never stored in plain text)
- Single use - invalidated after setup complete
- If lost, must reset database to regenerate

**Server Admin Credentials Storage:**
- Stored in database (`admin_credentials` table) - NEVER in config file
- Managed via `/admin/server/settings` (NOT `/user/profile`)
- NOT in the users table (separate table for isolation)
- Multiple server admin accounts supported (primary admin created during setup)

### Multiple Server Admins (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Server admins CAN add additional server admins.**

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Manual creation** | Primary admin creates additional admin accounts via `/admin/users/admins` |
| **OIDC/LDAP group mapping** | Map external identity provider groups to server admin role |

**Admin Hierarchy:**
| Admin Type | Created By | Can Create Admins? | Can Delete Admins? |
|------------|------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Primary Admin** | Setup wizard | Yes | Yes (except self) |
| **Additional Admins** | Primary or other admin | Yes | Yes (except self and primary) |
| **OIDC/LDAP Admins** | Group mapping | Yes | Yes (except primary) |

**Rules:**
- Primary admin cannot be deleted (only via `--maintenance setup`)
- All admins have equal permissions (except deletion hierarchy)
- OIDC/LDAP admin access is automatic based on group membership
- Removing user from external group removes admin access on next login
- All admin actions are audited with admin username

### Server Admin Security (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**ALL security settings that apply to the primary server admin ALSO apply to additional server admins.**

| Security Feature | Applies To |
|------------------|------------|
| Password complexity requirements | All server admins |
| 2FA/MFA requirements | All server admins |
| Session timeout | All server admins |
| API token security | All server admins |
| Audit logging | All server admins |
| Rate limiting | All server admins |
| IP restrictions (if configured) | All server admins |

**No exceptions.** Additional admins do not get weaker security than the primary admin.

### Server Admin Privacy (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Server admins CANNOT see other server admin accounts, similar to user privacy.**

| What Admin CAN See | What Admin CANNOT See |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| Own account details | Other admin usernames |
| Own API token (regenerate) | Other admin emails |
| Own 2FA status | Other admin passwords |
| Own session history | Other admin API tokens |
| Total admin count (number only) | Other admin 2FA secrets |
| | Other admin session data |

**Admin Panel (`/admin/users/admins`):**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Server Administrators                                      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Your Account: administrator                                │
│  Total Admins: 3                                            │
│                                                             │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐    │
│  │  [Add New Admin]                                    │    │
│  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘    │
│                                                             │
│  Note: For security, you cannot view other admin accounts.  │
│  Each admin manages their own credentials independently.    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why This Restriction?**
- **Separation of trust**: Compromised admin cannot enumerate other admins
- **Privacy**: Admin credentials are personal, not shared
- **Security**: Prevents admin-to-admin attacks
- **Audit integrity**: Each admin accountable for own actions only

**What Admins CAN Do With Other Admins:**
| Action | Allowed? | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Know total count | ✓ | Number only, no details |
| See who is logged in | ✓ | Username only (e.g., "administrator logged in") |
| Add new admin (invite) | ✓ | Creates invite, credentials shown once to new admin |
| Remove admin (non-primary) | ✓ | By username only (must know it) |
| View other admin details | ✗ | Privacy by design |
| Reset other admin password | ✗ | Each admin manages own credentials |
| Disable other admin 2FA | ✗ | Use `--maintenance setup` for recovery |

### Adding Additional Server Admins

**Three methods to add server admins:**

| Method | Description | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Invite** | Generate invite link/code | Manual admin creation |
| **OIDC Group Mapping** | Automatic via group membership | SSO environments |
| **LDAP Group Mapping** | Automatic via group membership | Enterprise environments |

**Invite Rules:**
- Invite link is single-use (invalidated after first use or expiry)
- Default expiry: 24 hours (configurable: 1h, 6h, 24h, 48h, 7d)
- New admin can set their own username (username blacklist ignored for admins)
- New admin sets their own password and optional 2FA
- API token generated and shown once
- Invite creation logged to audit log

#### OIDC/LDAP Admin Sync

**When a user authenticates via OIDC/LDAP and belongs to a mapped admin group:**

1. User authenticates with OIDC/LDAP provider
2. Server retrieves user's group memberships
3. If user is in `admin_groups` → create/update local admin record
4. Admin credentials synced to local database
5. On next login, even if OIDC/LDAP is down, local credentials work

**Local Sync Table (`admin_credentials`):**
| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `username` | From OIDC/LDAP claim |
| `password_hash` | Synced from provider (or set locally) |
| `source` | `local`, `oidc:{provider}`, `ldap` |
| `external_id` | Provider's user ID |
| `groups` | Cached group memberships |
| `last_sync` | Last successful sync timestamp |

**Fallback Behavior:**
| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| OIDC/LDAP available | Authenticate with provider, sync to local |
| OIDC/LDAP unavailable | Use cached local credentials |
| User removed from admin group | Next successful OIDC/LDAP login revokes admin |
| Provider permanently down | Local credentials continue to work |

**Sync Frequency:**
- On every login (real-time)
- Background sync every 1 hour (if configured)
- Manual sync via admin panel

### Admin Session Visibility

**Admins can see which other admins are currently logged in (username only).**

```
Admin Panel Header:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  {app_name} Admin    │  🟢 2 admins online  │  🔔  │  [You] │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                              │
                              ▼ (click to expand)
                       ┌──────────────────┐
                       │  Admins Online   │
                       ├──────────────────┤
                       │  🟢 administrator │
                       │  🟢 backup-admin  │
                       └──────────────────┘
```

**What IS Shown:**
- Username of logged-in admins
- Online status (green dot)
- Total count

**What is NOT Shown:**
- IP address
- Session duration
- Last activity
- Device/browser info

**Why This Is Allowed:**
- Helps admins know if others are working
- Useful for coordination
- Does not expose sensitive details
- Username is not considered private (admins know each other)

### Additional Admin Recovery

**Additional admins (non-primary) who lose access:**

| Scenario | Recovery Method |
|----------|-----------------|
| Forgot password | Use own recovery keys OR contact primary admin |
| Lost 2FA + recovery keys | Contact primary admin to delete account, re-invite |
| OIDC/LDAP admin locked out | Fix in identity provider, or primary admin removes mapping |

**Primary admin CANNOT:**
- Reset other admin's password directly
- View other admin's credentials
- Disable other admin's 2FA directly

**Primary admin CAN:**
- Delete the additional admin account entirely
- Re-invite them (they set up fresh credentials)

### Regular User Behavior

| Route | Regular User Access |
|-------|---------------------|
| `/admin/*` | NO - 403 Forbidden (unless user has admin role) |
| `/user/*` | Full access to own profile, settings, tokens |
| `/auth/login` | Login page |
| `/auth/logout` | Logout |
| Public routes | Authenticated view (may show user-specific content) |

**Regular User Accounts:**
- Stored in database (users table)
- Managed via `/user/profile`, `/user/settings`
- Can have roles (admin, user, custom)
- Multiple accounts supported

### Username Validation (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Username Rules:**
| Rule | Value |
|------|-------|
| Min length | 3 characters |
| Max length | 32 characters |
| Allowed chars | `a-z`, `0-9`, `_`, `-` (lowercase only) |
| Must start with | Letter (`a-z`) |
| Cannot end with | `_` or `-` |
| No consecutive | `__`, `--`, `_-`, `-_` |

```

**Blocklist Notes:**
- Server admin account is exempt from this blocklist
- Blocklist is checked case-insensitively
- Also blocks usernames that contain blocklisted words as substrings for critical terms (admin, root, system, mod, official, verified)
- Custom blocklist entries can be added via config

### Username & Email Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Case Insensitivity:**
- Usernames are case-insensitive: `admin` = `Admin` = `aDmIn`
- Emails are case-insensitive: `me@example.com` = `Me@Example.COM`
- Stored in lowercase, compared in lowercase

**Login Identifier:**
- Users can log in with **either** username OR email
- Both must be unique across all users

**Email Addresses:**
| SMTP Configured | Max Emails | Verification |
|-----------------|------------|--------------|
| No | 1 (primary only) | Not possible |
| Yes | Unlimited | Additional emails must be verified |

**Email Types:**
| Type | Purpose | Used For |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Account Email** | Security & account recovery | Password reset, 2FA recovery, security alerts, login notifications |
| **Notification Email** | Non-security communications | Newsletters, updates, marketing, general notifications |

**Email Rules:**
- Primary email set at registration (becomes account email by default)
- User can designate a different verified email as account email
- Additional emails require verification (SMTP required)
- All emails must be unique across all users
- Unverified emails cannot be used for login
- Account email receives security-sensitive communications ONLY
- Notification email receives everything else (if set, otherwise account email)

### Server Admin Limitations (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**What Server Admin CAN do:**
| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Send password reset link | Triggers email to user's account email |
| Disable user's 2FA | After manual identity verification (out-of-band) |
| Disable/suspend account | Block user from logging in |
| Enable/unsuspend account | Restore access |
| View masked email | `j***n@e***.com` (for support identification) |
| View username | For support identification |
| View account status | Active, suspended, 2FA enabled, etc. |
| View last login | Timestamp only |

**What Server Admin CANNOT do:**
| Action | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| View full email addresses | Privacy - only masked version visible |
| View passwords | Passwords are hashed, not stored |
| Set/change user passwords | Only user can set via reset link |
| View recovery keys | Keys are hashed, not stored |
| View 2FA secrets | Secrets are encrypted with user's password |
| Read user's private data | Privacy by design |
| Impersonate without logging | All admin actions are audited |

**Admin Password Reset Flow:**

User receives: "Password reset requested by administrator.
               Click here to set a new password."
```

**Why These Limitations?**
- **Zero-knowledge design**: Admin cannot access what they don't need
- **Privacy by default**: User data is user's data
- **Audit trail**: All admin actions logged with reason
- **Trust minimization**: Even compromised admin account has limited damage potential

### Error Messages (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Specific Errors (OK to reveal - validation only):**
| Scenario | Error Message |
|----------|---------------|
| Blocklisted username | `Username contains blocked word: {word}` |
| Username too short | `Username must be at least 3 characters` |
| Username too long | `Username cannot exceed 32 characters` |
| Invalid characters | `Username can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, underscore, and hyphen` |
| Invalid email format | `Please enter a valid email address` |
| Password too weak | `Password must be at least 8 characters` |

**Generic Errors (NEVER reveal existence):**
| Scenario | Error Message |
|----------|---------------|
| Username/email taken | `Unable to complete registration. [Forgot credentials?](/auth/forgot)` |
| Login failed (any reason) | `Invalid credentials. [Forgot password?](/auth/forgot)` |
| Reset request | `If an account exists, instructions have been sent.` |

**Why Generic Errors?**
- Prevents username/email enumeration attacks
- Attacker cannot determine if account exists
- Same response time for both cases (prevent timing attacks)
- Links to recovery flow instead of revealing information

### 2FA, Passkeys & OIDC (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Supported Authentication Methods:**
| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Password | Standard username/email + password |
| TOTP (2FA) | Time-based one-time passwords (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.) |
| Passkeys | WebAuthn/FIDO2 passwordless authentication |
| OIDC | External identity providers |

**OIDC Providers (Examples):**
- Self-hosted: Authentik, Authelia, Keycloak, Dex, Zitadel
- Cloud: Auth0, Okta, Azure AD, Google, GitHub, GitLab

**Recovery Keys (CRITICAL):**
| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Generated once** | Recovery keys generated when 2FA/passkey enabled |
| **User must copy** | Displayed ONCE, user MUST save them |
| **Hashed storage** | Keys are hashed, NOT stored in plain text |
| **NOT recoverable** | If lost, cannot be retrieved - account recovery required |
| **Single use** | Each recovery key can only be used once |
| **Count** | 10 recovery keys generated |

**Recovery Key Flow:**

**2FA/Passkey Setup Requirements:**
1. User must be logged in
2. User must re-enter password to confirm
3. Recovery keys generated and displayed
4. User must confirm they saved recovery keys (checkbox)
5. Only then is 2FA/passkey activated

### Account Recovery Matrix (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**What CAN be recovered:**
| User Knows | User Forgot | Recovery Method |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Email | Password | `/auth/forgot` → email link → set new password |
| Username | Password | `/auth/forgot` → email link → set new password |
| Email + Password | 2FA code | `/auth/login` → recovery key → disable/reset 2FA |
| Username + Password | 2FA code | `/auth/login` → recovery key → disable/reset 2FA |

**What CANNOT be recovered:**
| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Forgot username AND email | ❌ No recovery - account lost |
| Forgot password + no email access | ❌ No recovery - account lost |
| Lost 2FA + no recovery keys | ❌ Contact admin (manual identity verification) |
| Lost everything | ❌ No recovery - account lost |

**Why no recovery without username/email?**
- We cannot store data that identifies users without credentials
- This is a security feature, not a limitation
- Users MUST remember at least one identifier (username or email)

### Server Admin Recovery (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

The server admin (system administrator with access to the server/binary) has ONE recovery method:

| Scenario | Recovery Method |
|----------|-----------------|
| Admin forgot password | `zipcodes --maintenance setup` |
| Admin lost API token | `zipcodes --maintenance setup` |
| Admin lost recovery keys | `zipcodes --maintenance setup` |
| Admin lost 2FA + no recovery keys | `zipcodes --maintenance setup` |
| Admin lost everything | `zipcodes --maintenance setup` |

**This requires:**
- System-level access to run the binary
- Console access to see the new setup token
- The service should be stopped first

**This does NOT require:**
- Previous password
- Previous API token
- Previous recovery keys
- Email access

See **PART 26: BACKUP & RESTORE → Admin Recovery Command** for full details.

### Recovery Key Usage Flow

**When Recovery Keys Are Used:**
- User has 2FA/passkey enabled
- User lost access to 2FA device (phone lost, authenticator wiped, etc.)
- User still knows username/email AND password

**Flow:**

**Recovery Key API Flow:**
```
POST /api/v1/auth/login
  → { "identifier": "john@example.com", "password": "..." }
  ← { "requires_2fa": true, "session_token": "temp_xxx" }

POST /api/v1/auth/forgot/recovery
  → { "session_token": "temp_xxx", "recovery_key": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6" }
  ← { "success": true, "remaining_keys": 9 }

POST /api/v1/auth/2fa/disable  (or /setup for new device)
  → { "session_token": "temp_xxx" }
  ← { "success": true, "token": "auth_xxx" }
     OR (if setup)
  ← { "qr_code": "...", "secret": "...", "recovery_keys": [...] }
```

**Recovery Key Rules:**
| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Single use | Each key invalidated after one use |
| Hashed storage | Keys stored as hashes, cannot be retrieved |
| Regeneration | New 2FA setup = new recovery keys |
| Old keys invalidated | All old keys invalidated when new keys generated |
| Remaining count | Show user how many keys remain |
| Last key warning | ⚠️ Warning when only 1-2 keys remaining |
| Zero keys + lost 2FA | Must contact admin for manual verification |

**OIDC/LDAP Configuration:**
```yaml
server:
  auth:
    oidc:
      enabled: false
      providers:
        - name: authentik
          display_name: "Login with Authentik"
          issuer: "https://auth.example.com/application/o/myapp/"
          client_id: "{client_id}"
          client_secret: "{client_secret}"
          scopes: ["openid", "profile", "email", "groups"]
          # Auto-create user on first login
          auto_register: true
          # Map OIDC claims to user fields
          claims_mapping:
            username: "preferred_username"
            email: "email"
            name: "name"
            groups: "groups"  # Claim containing group memberships
          # Map external groups to server admin role
          admin_groups:
            - "admins"              # Users in this group become server admins
            - "server-admins"
            - "app-administrators"
          # Map external groups to user roles (if multi-user enabled)
          role_mapping:
            admin: ["admins", "app-administrators"]
            moderator: ["moderators", "support-staff"]
            user: ["users", "members"]

    ldap:
      enabled: false
      server: "ldap://ldap.example.com:389"
      bind_dn: "cn=readonly,dc=example,dc=com"
      bind_password: "{ldap_password}"
      base_dn: "dc=example,dc=com"
      user_filter: "(uid={username})"
      # Map LDAP attributes to user fields
      attributes:
        username: "uid"
        email: "mail"
        name: "cn"
        groups: "memberOf"
      # Map LDAP groups to server admin role
      admin_groups:
        - "cn=admins,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com"
        - "cn=server-admins,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com"
      # Map LDAP groups to user roles (if multi-user enabled)
      role_mapping:
        admin: ["cn=admins,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com"]
        moderator: ["cn=moderators,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com"]
        user: ["cn=users,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com"]
```

### Server Admin Group Mapping (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Server admins can map external identity provider groups to the server admin role.**

| Provider | Configuration | Description |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| **OIDC** | `admin_groups` list | Group names from the `groups` claim |
| **LDAP** | `admin_groups` list | Full DN of groups (e.g., `cn=admins,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com`) |

**How Group Mapping Works:**

1. User authenticates via OIDC/LDAP
2. Server retrieves user's group memberships from identity provider
3. If user belongs to ANY group in `admin_groups` → grant server admin access
4. Admin access persists for session duration
5. On next login, group membership is re-evaluated
6. If user is removed from all `admin_groups` → admin access revoked

**Admin Panel (`/admin/security/auth`):**

| Element | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| OIDC Providers | Section | List of configured OIDC providers |
| LDAP Configuration | Section | LDAP server settings |
| Admin Groups | Tag input | Groups that grant server admin access |
| Role Mapping | Table | Map external groups to application roles |
| Test Connection | Button | Test OIDC/LDAP connectivity |
| Test Group Mapping | Button | Test user's groups and resulting role |

**Sane Defaults:**
- `admin_groups`: Empty (no external groups granted admin by default)
- `role_mapping`: Empty (users get default role unless mapped)
- `auto_register`: `false` (users must be pre-created unless enabled)
- Group membership checked on every login (not cached)

### Why This Separation?

| Reason | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Security** | Server admin has system-level access, not app-level |
| **Simplicity** | Admin-only mode doesn't need user management |
| **Isolation** | Server admin credentials separate from user data |
| **Recovery** | Can access admin even if database is corrupted |

## Configuration

```yaml
server:
  users:
    # Enable multi-user mode (default: disabled = admin-only)
    enabled: false

    registration:
      # Allow public registration

      session_duration: 30d
      # Require 2FA for all users
      require_2fa: false
      # Allow 2FA (user choice)
      allow_2fa: true
      # Password requirements
      password_min_length: 8

```

## User Roles & Permissions

| Role | Description | Default Permissions |
|------|-------------|---------------------|
| `admin` | Full access | All permissions |
| `user` | Standard user | Read, own profile, own API tokens |

### Custom Roles

Projects can define custom roles with specific permissions:

```yaml
server:
  users:
    roles:
      available:
        - admin
        - moderator
        - user
        - readonly
      default: user
      permissions:
        moderator:
          - read
          - write
          - moderate
        readonly:
          - read
```

## User Features

### Registration Flow

```
1. User submits registration form
   ├─ If require_email_verification: Send verification email
   │   └─ User clicks link → account verified
   ├─ If require_approval: Admin notified
   │   └─ Admin approves → account active
   └─ If neither: Account immediately active

2. User can now log in
```

### Authentication Methods

| Method | Use For |
|--------|---------|
| Session (cookie) | Web interface |
| API token | API access (passed as Bearer token in Authorization header) |

## Database Architecture (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Applications use TWO separate SQLite databases by default.**

### Database Files

| Database | File | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| **Server DB** | `{data_dir}/db/server.db` | Admin credentials, server state, scheduler |
| **Users DB** | `{data_dir}/db/users.db` | User accounts, tokens, sessions (multi-user mode) |

### Why Two Databases?

| Reason | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Isolation** | Admin credentials separate from user data |
| **Security** | Compromised user DB doesn't expose admin |
| **Backup** | Can backup/restore independently |
| **Logical separation** | Server config vs user data |

### Database Modes

| Mode | Server DB | Users DB | Use Case |
|------|-----------|----------|----------|
| **Single Instance** | Local SQLite | Local SQLite | Default, simple deployment |
| **Cluster** | Remote (shared) | Remote (shared) | Multi-node, load distribution |
| **Mixed Mode** | Any supported | Any supported | Heterogeneous backend infrastructure |

#### Clustering vs High Availability (IMPORTANT TERMINOLOGY)

**These are NOT interchangeable terms.**

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Clustering** | Multiple application nodes sharing state via a common database and Valkey/Redis. Enables horizontal scaling and load distribution. All nodes are equal peers. |
| **High Availability (HA)** | Fault tolerance for the database backend itself (e.g., PostgreSQL replication, Galera for MariaDB). This is OUTSIDE the application's scope. |

**The application provides clustering (multi-node). Database HA is your infrastructure's responsibility.**

```

### Single Instance (Default)

Both databases are local SQLite files:

```yaml
server:
  database:
    driver: sqlite
    # Both databases stored locally
    # {data_dir}/db/server.db
    # {data_dir}/db/users.db
```

### Cluster Mode (Remote Database)

**When clustering, BOTH databases MUST use the same remote database.**

All nodes need shared access to:
- Admin credentials (same login works on any node)
- Server settings (consistent configuration)
- User accounts (users can access any node)
- Sessions (no re-login when switching nodes)
- API tokens (tokens work on any node)

```yaml
server:
  database:
    driver: postgres
    host: db.example.com
    port: 5432
    name: myapp
    username: myapp
    password: ${DB_PASSWORD}
    sslmode: require

    # All tables go in same database, different schemas/prefixes:
    # - server_* tables (admin_credentials, admin_sessions, scheduler_state)
    # - user_* tables (users, user_tokens, user_sessions, invites)
```

### Table Prefixes in Shared Database

| Prefix | Tables |
|--------|--------|
| `server_` | `server_admin_credentials`, `server_admin_sessions`, `server_scheduler_state` |
| `user_` | `user_accounts`, `user_tokens`, `user_sessions`, `user_invites` |

### Cluster Requirements

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Shared database** | All nodes connect to same PostgreSQL/MySQL |
| **Same credentials** | Admin can log into any node |
| **Session sharing** | User sessions valid across all nodes |
| **Token validation** | API tokens work on any node |
| **Config sync** | Settings changes propagate to all nodes |

### Cluster Initialization (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**The FIRST node is the source of truth. Subsequent nodes inherit from the remote database.**

#### First Node (Primary Setup)

```
1. Deploy first node
         │
         ▼
2. First run creates local SQLite databases
   - Admin credentials auto-generated
   - Server settings initialized
         │
         ▼
3. Configure application via admin panel
   - Set branding, SSL, etc.
   - Create users (if multi-user mode)
         │
         ▼
4. Ready to migrate to cluster?
         │
         ▼
5. Setup remote database (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
         │
         ▼
6. Update config: driver: postgres (or use Web UI)
         │
         ▼
7. Restart - app auto-migrates local data to remote
         │
         ▼
8. Now using remote DB
   (First node is source of truth)
```

#### Additional Nodes (Inherit from Remote)

```
1. Deploy new node
         │
         ▼
2. Configure with SAME remote database connection
   driver: postgres
   host: db.example.com (same as first node)
         │
         ▼
3. First run detects existing data in remote DB
         │
         ▼
4. SKIP initialization - inherit everything:
   - Admin credentials (same login)
   - Server settings (same config)
   - Users (same accounts)
   - Sessions (shared)
         │
         ▼
5. Node joins cluster automatically
```

#### Node Behavior

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| **First node + SQLite** | Create admin, init settings |
| **First node + empty remote DB** | Create admin, init settings (becomes source of truth) |
| **New node + remote DB with data** | Skip init, inherit everything from DB |
| **Any node + settings change** | Write to DB, all nodes see change |

#### Migration Methods

**Migration to remote database is done via config file OR admin web UI - NO CLI commands.**

**Method 1: Config File**

```yaml
# server.yml - change driver and add connection details
server:
  database:
    driver: postgres
    host: db.example.com
    port: 5432
    name: myapp
    username: myapp
    password: ${DB_PASSWORD}
    sslmode: require
```

On restart, the application:
1. Detects driver change from `sqlite` to `postgres`
2. Connects to remote database
3. If empty: migrates local SQLite data automatically
4. If has data: uses existing data (node joins cluster)

**Method 2: Admin Web UI**

`/admin/server/database`

| Element | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Current Driver | Read-only | Shows current database driver |
| Driver | Dropdown | sqlite, postgres, mysql |
| Host | Text input | Database host (shown when not sqlite) |
| Port | Number input | Database port |
| Database Name | Text input | Database name |
| Username | Text input | Database username |
| Password | Password input | Database password |
| SSL Mode | Dropdown | disable, require, verify-full |
| Test Connection | Button | Verify connection before saving |
| Migrate & Switch | Button | Migrate data and switch to remote |

**Migration Process (automatic on driver change):**

```
1. Test connection to remote database
         │
         ▼
2. If remote DB empty:
   - Create tables
   - Export local SQLite data
   - Import to remote
         │
         ▼
3. If remote DB has data:
   - Verify schema compatibility
   - Skip migration (join existing cluster)
         │
         ▼
4. Switch to remote driver
         │
         ▼
5. Local SQLite files preserved as backup
```

### Storage Backend Sync (Bidirectional)

**Data always syncs TOWARD the new storage backend before switching.**

| From | To | Sync Action |
|------|-----|-------------|
| **SQLite → Remote** | Push to remote | Export SQLite data → Import to remote DB → Switch to remote |
| **Remote → SQLite** | Pull to local | Export remote data → Import to SQLite files → Disconnect remote → Switch to SQLite |
| **SQLite → YAML** | Export to file | Export `server.db` settings → Write to `server.yml` |
| **YAML → SQLite** | Import to DB | Read `server.yml` → Import settings to `server.db` |
| **YAML → Remote** | Import to DB | Read `server.yml` → Import settings to remote DB |

#### Remote → SQLite (Downgrade to Local)

When switching from remote database back to local SQLite:

```
1. User selects "Switch to SQLite" in Web UI
         │
         ▼
2. Export ALL data from remote database
         │
         ▼
3. Create/update local SQLite files:
   - {data_dir}/db/server.db
   - {data_dir}/db/users.db
         │
         ▼
4. Import remote data to SQLite
         │
         ▼
5. Verify data integrity (row counts match)
         │
         ▼
6. Disconnect from remote database
         │
         ▼
7. Update config: driver: sqlite
         │
         ▼
8. Now using local SQLite (standalone mode)
```

**Use case:** Converting cluster node back to standalone instance.

#### SQLite ↔ YAML Sync

Settings can be stored in database OR config file. Sync between them:

**SQLite → YAML (Export settings to file):**

```
Admin Web UI: /admin/server/settings → "Export to YAML"
         │
         ▼
Read all settings from server.db
         │
         ▼
Write to server.yml (preserves comments, formatting)
         │
         ▼
Settings now in both DB and YAML (DB is source of truth)
```

**YAML → SQLite (Import settings from file):**

```
On startup: YAML file detected with changes
         │
         ▼
Read settings from server.yml
         │
         ▼
Import to server.db (overwrites DB values)
         │
         ▼
DB is now source of truth
```

#### Sync Priority (Source of Truth)

| Mode | Source of Truth | Behavior |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| **Running** | Database | DB values used, YAML ignored |
| **Startup (YAML changed)** | YAML | YAML imported to DB, then DB is source |
| **Startup (YAML unchanged)** | Database | DB values used |
| **Cluster** | Remote Database | All nodes read from shared DB |

### Mixed Mode (Heterogeneous Database Backends)

**Mixed Mode allows different nodes in a cluster to connect to different database backends.**

This is useful when:
- Migrating from one database to another (e.g., MySQL → PostgreSQL)
- Geographic distribution with local database preferences
- Testing new database backend before full migration

#### Mixed Mode Configuration

Each node specifies its own database connection:

**Node 1 (PostgreSQL):**
```yaml
server:
  database:
    driver: postgres
    host: pg.us-east.example.com
    port: 5432
    name: myapp
    username: myapp
    password: ${DB_PASSWORD}
```

**Node 2 (MariaDB):**
```yaml
server:
  database:
    driver: mysql
    host: maria.eu-west.example.com
    port: 3306
    name: myapp
    username: myapp
    password: ${DB_PASSWORD}
```

**Node 3 (PostgreSQL - different server):**

#### Mixed Mode Requirements

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Valkey/Redis REQUIRED** | State synchronization between heterogeneous backends |
| **Schema compatibility** | All databases MUST have identical schema |
| **Data sync** | Application handles cross-database replication via Valkey |
| **Same schema version** | All nodes must run same application version |

#### Mixed Mode Sync via Valkey

**All state changes are broadcast through Valkey/Redis:**

```
Node 1 writes user record
         │
         ▼
Local PostgreSQL INSERT
         │
         ▼
Publish to Valkey: "user.created" + payload
         │
         ├──────────────────────────────────────┐
         │                                      │
         ▼                                      ▼
Node 2 receives                          Node 3 receives
         │                                      │
         ▼                                      ▼
Local MariaDB INSERT                     Local PostgreSQL INSERT
```

**The application handles:**
- Publishing changes to Valkey after local writes
- Subscribing to changes from other nodes
- Applying remote changes to local database
- Conflict resolution (last-write-wins by timestamp)

### Node Management (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Simple node management via admin web UI. No CLI commands, no manual config.**

#### Adding a Node

**On existing node:**

1. Go to `/admin/server/nodes/add`
2. Click "Generate Token" button
3. System generates:
   - Token: `node_{random_32_chars}`
   - URL: `{proto}://{fqdn}` (of this node)
4. Display token and URL to admin (copy buttons)

**On new server:**

1. Go to `/admin/server/nodes/add`
2. Enter:
   - URL from existing node
   - Token from existing node
3. Click "Join Cluster"
4. New node automatically:
   - Connects to existing node
   - Gets database connection details
   - Gets all configuration
   - Joins cluster

```

```

#### Join Cluster Flow (Technical)

**Step-by-step process when new node joins cluster:**

```

    │                                   2. Validate token:
    │                                      - Token exists?
    │                                      - Not expired (15 min)?
    │                                      - Not already used?
    │                                      - Not in 90-day lockout?
    │                                            │
    │                                            ▼

```

#### Bootstrap Data Structure

**Response from existing node (`POST /api/v1/cluster/join`):**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "cluster": {
    "id": "cluster_abc123",
    "name": "MyApp Cluster"
  },
  "database": {
    "driver": "postgres",
    "host": "db.example.com",
    "port": 5432,
    "name": "myapp",
    "username": "myapp",
    "password_encrypted": "base64_encrypted_password",
    "sslmode": "require"
  },
  "encryption": {
    "key_encrypted": "base64_encrypted_key"
  },
  "node": {
    "suggested_id": "server-2"
  }
}
```

#### Security: Encrypted Transfer

**Sensitive data is encrypted during transfer using token-derived key:**

```go
// Token is used to derive encryption key for bootstrap data
func deriveKeyFromToken(token string) []byte {
    // Use Argon2id to derive encryption key from token
    salt := sha256.Sum256([]byte("cluster_join_" + token))
    return argon2.IDKey([]byte(token), salt[:16], 3, 64*1024, 4, 32)
}

// Existing node encrypts sensitive data
func encryptBootstrapData(data []byte, token string) []byte {
    key := deriveKeyFromToken(token)
    // AES-256-GCM encryption
    return aesGcmEncrypt(data, key)
}

// New node decrypts using same token
func decryptBootstrapData(encrypted []byte, token string) []byte {
    key := deriveKeyFromToken(token)
    return aesGcmDecrypt(encrypted, key)
}
```

**What's encrypted:**
- Database password
- Encryption key for secrets (TOTP secrets, etc.)

**What's NOT encrypted (not sensitive):**
- Database host/port/name
- Cluster ID
- Node suggestions

#### Database Tables for Clustering

**Nodes Table (in remote database):**

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | String | Node ID (default: hostname) |
| `hostname` | String | Server hostname |
| `ip_address` | String | Node IP address |
| `version` | String | Application version |
| `status` | String | online, offline, degraded |
| `last_heartbeat` | Timestamp | Last heartbeat time |
| `joined_at` | Timestamp | When node joined cluster |
| `system_info` | JSON | CPU, memory, disk stats |

**Join Tokens Table (in remote database):**

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | UUID | Primary key |
| `token_hash` | String | SHA-256 hash of token |
| `created_by` | String | Node ID that created token |
| `created_at` | Timestamp | Creation time |
| `expires_at` | Timestamp | Expiration (created_at + 15 min) |
| `used_at` | Timestamp | When token was used (NULL if unused) |
| `used_by` | String | Node ID that used token |
| `lockout_until` | Timestamp | Cannot reuse until (used_at + 90 days) |

#### Heartbeat

**Nodes send heartbeat every 30 seconds:**

```go
func startHeartbeat(ctx context.Context, db *sql.DB, nodeID string) {
    ticker := time.NewTicker(30 * time.Second)
    defer ticker.Stop()

    for {
        select {
        case <-ctx.Done():
            return
        case <-ticker.C:
            updateHeartbeat(db, nodeID)
        }
    }
}

func updateHeartbeat(db *sql.DB, nodeID string) {
    db.Exec(`
        UPDATE nodes
        SET last_heartbeat = NOW(),
            status = 'online',
            system_info = $1
        WHERE id = $2
    `, getSystemInfo(), nodeID)
}
```

**Node status determination:**

| Last Heartbeat | Status |
|----------------|--------|
| < 1 minute ago | online |
| 1-5 minutes ago | degraded |
| > 5 minutes ago | offline |

#### Error Handling

| Error | Response | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Invalid token | 401 Unauthorized | Show error, ask to retry |
| Token expired | 401 Token Expired | Generate new token on existing node |
| Token already used | 401 Token Already Used | Generate new token |
| Token in lockout | 401 Token Locked | Wait 90 days or generate new token |
| Database connection failed | 500 Database Error | Show error, check DB settings |
| Network error | Connection Failed | Retry with backoff |

#### Token Rules

| Rule | Value |
|------|-------|
| Format | `node_{random_32_chars}` |
| Valid for | 15 minutes |
| Usage | One-time only |
| Reuse lockout | 90 days (prevents replay attacks) |

#### Removing a Node

**A node can only remove ITSELF from the cluster.**

1. Go to `/admin/server/nodes/remove` (on the node to remove)
2. Click "Remove from Cluster"
3. Confirmation modal: "Are you sure you want to remove {nodename} from the cluster?"
   - [Yes, Remove] [Cancel]
4. On confirmation:
   - Node disconnects from cluster
   - Node reverts to standalone mode (local SQLite)
   - Node creates fresh local databases
   - Other nodes see removal, adjust node count

**Cannot remove other nodes** - prevents accidental/malicious removal.

#### Viewing Nodes

**`/admin/server/nodes`** - Node list

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Node Name | Hostname (clickable link) |
| Status | online, offline, degraded |
| Uptime | Time since last restart |
| Version | Application version |
| Last Seen | Last heartbeat time |

**`/admin/server/nodes/{node}`** - Node detail

| Section | Contents |
|---------|----------|
| **Info** | Node name, hostname, IP, version, uptime |
| **Status** | Connection status, last heartbeat |
| **System** | CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage |
| **Database** | Connection status, query latency |
| **Tor** | Hidden service status, .onion address |

#### Node Identity

| Setting | Default | Changeable |
|---------|---------|------------|
| Node ID | `{hostname}` | Yes, via `/admin/server/nodes/settings` |
| Display Name | `{hostname}` | Yes |

#### First Node Behavior

**Generating the first token automatically converts to cluster mode.**

```
Single Instance (SQLite)
         │
         ▼
Admin goes to /admin/server/nodes/add
         │
         ▼
Clicks "Generate Token"
         │
         ▼
System prompts: "Enable cluster mode?"
  - Requires remote database connection
  - Enter PostgreSQL/MySQL details
         │
         ▼
On confirm:
  - Migrates local data to remote DB
  - Generates join token
  - Node is now cluster-ready
```

#### Admin Panel Routes

| Route | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/admin/server/nodes` | List all nodes |
| `/admin/server/nodes/add` | Add node (generate token OR join) |
| `/admin/server/nodes/remove` | Remove THIS node from cluster |
| `/admin/server/nodes/settings` | Node identity settings |
| `/admin/server/nodes/{node}` | View specific node details |

# PART 32: TOR HIDDEN SERVICE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

## Overview

**ALL projects MUST have built-in Tor hidden service support.**

Tor integration uses **external Tor binary** via `github.com/cretz/bine`. This maintains `CGO_ENABLED=0` compatibility for static binaries while providing full Tor hidden service functionality.

## Configuration

```yaml
server:
  tor:
    enabled: true  # Default: enabled
    # Path to Tor binary (auto-detected if empty)
    binary: ""
```

**Notes:**
- Uses external Tor binary (not embedded) for CGO_ENABLED=0 compatibility
- Enabled by default - privacy out of the box
- .onion address derived from keys in `{data_dir}/tor/site/`
- Application manages Tor process lifecycle

## Tor Process Management (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**The application MUST start its OWN dedicated Tor process. NEVER use system Tor.**

This prevents conflicts with any existing Tor installation on the system.

```
1. Find Tor binary:
   ├─ Check config `server.tor.binary` path
   ├─ Check PATH for `tor` executable
   ├─ Check common locations:
   │   ├─ Linux: /usr/bin/tor, /usr/local/bin/tor
   │   ├─ macOS: /usr/local/bin/tor, /opt/homebrew/bin/tor
   │   ├─ Windows: C:\Program Files\Tor\tor.exe
   │   └─ BSD: /usr/local/bin/tor
   └─ NOT FOUND: Log warning, disable Tor features, continue without Tor

2. Start DEDICATED Tor process:
   ├─ Use application's own DataDir: `{data_dir}/tor/`
   ├─ Use random available ControlPort (not 9051)
   ├─ Use random available SocksPort (not 9050)
   ├─ Completely isolated from system Tor
   ├─ Wait for bootstrap completion
   └─ Create hidden service via ADD_ONION

3. On application shutdown:
   └─ Terminate the dedicated Tor process
```

### Why Dedicated Tor Process?

| Reason | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **No conflicts** | System Tor uses 9050/9051, we use random ports |
| **Isolation** | Our DataDir is separate from system Tor |
| **Clean shutdown** | We control the process lifecycle |
| **No permissions issues** | Don't need access to system Tor control |
| **Predictable behavior** | Always same configuration |

## Implementation

### Library

Use `github.com/cretz/bine` (pure Go, CGO_ENABLED=0 compatible):

```go
import (
    "github.com/cretz/bine/tor"
)

func startDedicatedTor(ctx context.Context, localPort int) (*tor.Tor, *tor.OnionService, error) {
    // Start OUR OWN Tor process - completely separate from system Tor
    t, err := tor.Start(ctx, &tor.StartConf{
        // Our own data directory - isolated from system Tor
        DataDir: paths.GetDataDir() + "/tor",

        // Let bine pick available ports (avoids conflict with system Tor 9050/9051)
        // These are set automatically to available ports
        NoAutoSocksPort: false,

        // Optional: specify path if not in PATH
        // ExePath: "/usr/bin/tor",

        // Debug output (development only)
        // DebugWriter: os.Stderr,
    })
    if err != nil {
        return nil, nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to start dedicated tor: %w", err)
    }

    // Wait for Tor to bootstrap
    dialCtx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(ctx, 3*time.Minute)
    defer cancel()
    if err := t.EnableNetwork(dialCtx, true); err != nil {
        t.Close()
        return nil, nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to enable tor network: %w", err)
    }

    // Create hidden service
    onion, err := t.Listen(ctx, &tor.ListenConf{
        RemotePorts: []int{80},
        LocalPort:   localPort,
    })
    if err != nil {
        t.Close()
        return nil, nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to create onion service: %w", err)
    }

    // onion.ID contains the .onion address (without .onion suffix)
    log.Printf("Tor hidden service started: %s.onion", onion.ID)
    return t, onion, nil
}

// Shutdown cleanly terminates our dedicated Tor process
func shutdownTor(t *tor.Tor) error {
    if t != nil {
        return t.Close()
    }
    return nil
}
```

### Port Allocation

| Port | System Tor | Our Tor |
|------|------------|---------|
| SocksPort | 9050 | Random available |
| ControlPort | 9051 | Random available |
| DataDir | `/var/lib/tor` | `{data_dir}/tor/` |

**bine automatically selects available ports**, ensuring no conflict with system Tor.

### Tor Configuration Optimizations (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Tor is used ONLY for hidden services. Optimize accordingly.**

```go
// Optimized torrc settings for hidden-service-only mode
func getTorConfig() string {
    return `
# Hidden service only - not a relay or exit
SocksPort 0
# No SOCKS proxy needed - we're server only

# Disable unused features
ExitRelay 0
ExitPolicy reject *:*
# Never act as exit node

# Don't relay traffic for others
ORPort 0
DirPort 0

# Reduce circuit building (we only need service circuits)
MaxCircuitDirtiness 600
# Keep circuits longer

# Reduce bandwidth for Tor overhead
BandwidthRate 1 MB
BandwidthBurst 2 MB

# Hidden service optimizations
HiddenServiceSingleHopMode 0
# Keep full anonymity (3 hops)

# Faster startup
FetchDirInfoEarly 1
FetchDirInfoExtraEarly 1

# Reduce memory usage
DisableDebuggerAttachment 1
`
}
```

| Setting | Value | Reason |
|---------|-------|--------|
| `SocksPort 0` | Disabled | Not browsing, server only |
| `ExitRelay 0` | Disabled | Not an exit node |
| `ORPort 0` | Disabled | Not relaying traffic |
| `DirPort 0` | Disabled | Not a directory server |
| `ExitPolicy reject *:*` | Block all | Extra safety |
| `MaxCircuitDirtiness 600` | 10 minutes | Keep circuits longer |

### Tor Process Lifecycle (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**The application MUST fully manage the Tor process lifecycle.**

| Event | Action |
|-------|--------|
| **App Start** | Find Tor binary → Start dedicated Tor process → Wait for bootstrap → Create hidden service |
| **App Running** | Monitor Tor process, restart if crashed |
| **App Shutdown** | Terminate Tor process gracefully (SIGTERM) |
| **App Crash** | Tor process should terminate (child process dies with parent) |
| **SIGTERM/SIGINT** | Graceful shutdown: stop Tor, then exit |
| **SIGHUP** | Reload config, restart Tor if settings changed |

### Tor Restart Triggers (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Tor MUST be restarted when these events occur:**

| Trigger | Action | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Regenerate .onion address** | Stop Tor → Delete keys → Start Tor | New random address |
| **Apply vanity address** | Stop Tor → Replace keys → Start Tor | Use generated vanity keys |
| **Import external keys** | Stop Tor → Replace keys → Start Tor | Use imported keys |
| **Enable Tor** | Start Tor | Was disabled |
| **Disable Tor** | Stop Tor | User disabled |
| **Tor process crash** | Restart Tor | Auto-recovery |
| **Tor unresponsive** | Stop Tor → Start Tor | Health check failed |
| **Config change** | Stop Tor → Start Tor | Settings changed |

### Restart Implementation

```go
// TorManager handles all Tor lifecycle operations
type TorManager struct {
    mu        sync.Mutex
    tor       *tor.Tor
    onion     *tor.OnionService
    dataDir   string
    localPort int
    ctx       context.Context
    cancel    context.CancelFunc
}

// Restart stops and starts Tor (used for config changes, recovery)
func (tm *TorManager) Restart() error {
    tm.mu.Lock()
    defer tm.mu.Unlock()

    // Stop existing
    if tm.tor != nil {
        tm.tor.Close()
        tm.tor = nil
        tm.onion = nil
    }

    // Start fresh
    return tm.startLocked()
}

// RegenerateAddress creates a new random .onion address
func (tm *TorManager) RegenerateAddress() (string, error) {
    tm.mu.Lock()
    defer tm.mu.Unlock()

    // Stop Tor
    if tm.tor != nil {
        tm.tor.Close()
        tm.tor = nil
        tm.onion = nil
    }

    // Delete existing keys
    keysDir := filepath.Join(tm.dataDir, "site")
    if err := os.RemoveAll(keysDir); err != nil {
        return "", fmt.Errorf("failed to remove old keys: %w", err)
    }

    // Start Tor - new keys will be generated
    if err := tm.startLocked(); err != nil {
        return "", err
    }

    return tm.onion.ID + ".onion", nil
}

// ApplyKeys stops Tor, replaces keys, and restarts
func (tm *TorManager) ApplyKeys(privateKey []byte) (string, error) {
    tm.mu.Lock()
    defer tm.mu.Unlock()

    // Stop Tor
    if tm.tor != nil {
        tm.tor.Close()
        tm.tor = nil
        tm.onion = nil
    }

    // Write new keys
    keysDir := filepath.Join(tm.dataDir, "site")
    os.MkdirAll(keysDir, 0700)
    keyPath := filepath.Join(keysDir, "hs_ed25519_secret_key")
    if err := os.WriteFile(keyPath, privateKey, 0600); err != nil {
        return "", fmt.Errorf("failed to write key: %w", err)
    }

    // Start Tor with new keys
    if err := tm.startLocked(); err != nil {
        return "", err
    }

    return tm.onion.ID + ".onion", nil
}

// SetEnabled enables or disables Tor
func (tm *TorManager) SetEnabled(enabled bool) error {
    tm.mu.Lock()
    defer tm.mu.Unlock()

    if enabled {
        if tm.tor == nil {
            return tm.startLocked()
        }
    } else {
        if tm.tor != nil {
            tm.tor.Close()
            tm.tor = nil
            tm.onion = nil
        }
    }
    return nil
}
```

### Signal Handling with Tor

```go
func main() {
    ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
    defer cancel()

    // Start Tor
    torProcess, onion, err := startDedicatedTor(ctx, localPort)
    if err != nil {
        log.Printf("Warning: Tor disabled - %v", err)
        // Continue without Tor
    }

    // Handle shutdown signals
    sigChan := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
    signal.Notify(sigChan, syscall.SIGINT, syscall.SIGTERM)

    go func() {
        <-sigChan
        log.Println("Shutting down...")

        // Stop Tor FIRST
        if torProcess != nil {
            log.Println("Stopping Tor process...")
            torProcess.Close()
        }

        // Then cancel context for other goroutines
        cancel()
    }()

    // Run server...
}
```

### Tor Process Monitoring

```go
// Monitor Tor and restart if it crashes
func monitorTor(ctx context.Context, torProcess *tor.Tor, restartFunc func() (*tor.Tor, error)) {
    ticker := time.NewTicker(30 * time.Second)
    defer ticker.Stop()

    for {
        select {
        case <-ctx.Done():
            return
        case <-ticker.C:
            // Check if Tor is still responsive
            if torProcess != nil {
                // Ping control connection
                if _, err := torProcess.Control.GetInfo("version"); err != nil {
                    log.Println("Tor process unresponsive, restarting...")
                    torProcess.Close()
                    newTor, err := restartFunc()
                    if err != nil {
                        log.Printf("Failed to restart Tor: %v", err)
                    } else {
                        torProcess = newTor
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Binary Size

No impact on binary size - Tor is external. Application binary remains small and static.

### Data Storage

| Data | Location |
|------|----------|
| Tor data directory | `{data_dir}/tor/` |
| Hidden service keys | `{data_dir}/tor/site/` |
| Tor process PID | `{data_dir}/tor/tor.pid` |

## Admin Panel

### /admin/server/tor (Web UI)

| Element | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Enable Tor | Toggle switch | Turn hidden service on/off |
| Status | Indicator | ● Connected / ○ Disconnected / ⚠ Error |
| .onion Address | Read-only text | Full address with copy button |
| Regenerate Address | Button | Creates new random .onion (requires confirmation modal) |
| Vanity Prefix | Text input | Desired prefix (max 6 characters) |
| Generate Vanity | Button | Starts background generation |

```

### Vanity Address Generation

**Built-in generation (max 6 characters):**

| Prefix Length | Approximate Time |
|---------------|------------------|
| 1-4 chars | Seconds to minutes |
| 5 chars | Minutes to hours |
| 6 chars | Hours to days |

**Behavior:**
- Generation runs in background
- Current .onion address remains active while generating
- Notification sent when vanity address is ready
- User clicks notification or "Apply" button to activate
- Old keys deleted, new vanity keys activated
- Tor restarts with new address

### External Vanity Generation (7+ characters)

For prefixes longer than 6 characters, use external tools with GPU acceleration. The admin panel includes documentation (expandable help section):

**Using mkp224o (CPU):**
```bash
# Install
git clone https://github.com/cathugger/mkp224o
cd mkp224o && ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make

# Generate (example: 7-char prefix "myapp12")
./mkp224o -d ./keys myapp12

# Output: ./keys/myapp12xxxxx.onion/
#   ├── hostname        # Your .onion address
#   ├── hs_ed25519_public_key
#   └── hs_ed25519_secret_key
```

**Using mkp224o (GPU - much faster):**
```bash
# With CUDA support
./configure --enable-cuda
make

# Generate
./mkp224o -d ./keys myapp12
```

**Importing keys:**
1. Generate keys using mkp224o or similar tool
2. In admin panel, click "Import Keys"
3. Upload `hs_ed25519_secret_key` file (or zip containing both key files)
4. Confirm to replace current address
5. Tor restarts with imported keys

**Time estimates for longer prefixes:**

| Prefix Length | CPU Time | GPU Time |
|---------------|----------|----------|
| 7 chars | Days to weeks | Hours to days |
| 8 chars | Weeks to months | Days to weeks |
| 9+ chars | Months to years | Weeks to months |

**Security Notes:**
- .onion address shown only after admin authentication
- "Regenerate Address" requires confirmation modal (destructive - old address stops working)
- Address regeneration logged to audit log
- Imported keys should be generated on a trusted machine
- Delete source key files after successful import

### API Endpoints

**See PART 28 for full API route definitions under `/api/v1/admin/server/tor/`**

### Response Format

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "status": "connected",
  "onion_address": "abcd1234efgh5678ijkl9012mnop3456qrst7890uvwx.onion",
  "uptime": "2d 5h 30m"
}
```

## Behavior

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| First run | Tor starts, generates .onion address, saves to config |
| Subsequent runs | Tor starts, uses existing .onion address |
| Disabled in config | Tor does not start, no .onion available |
| Regenerate address | Old keys deleted, new .onion generated, config updated |
| Network issues | Tor retries connection automatically |

## CLI

The `--status` command includes Tor and cluster status:

### Single Instance

```
$ myapp --status

Server Status: Running
  Port: 8080
  Mode: production
  Uptime: 2d 5h 30m

Node: standalone
Cluster: disabled

Tor Hidden Service: Connected
  Address: abcd1234...wxyz.onion
```

### Cluster Mode

```
$ myapp --status

Server Status: Running
  Port: 8080
  Mode: production
  Uptime: 2d 5h 30m

Node: node-abc123
  Hostname: server-1.example.com

Cluster: connected
  Status: healthy
  Nodes: 3
  Database: postgres://db.example.com/myapp

Tor Hidden Service: Connected
  Address: abcd1234...wxyz.onion
```

### Status Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Node | Node ID (standalone or unique ID) |
| Hostname | Server hostname |
| Cluster | disabled, connected, degraded, disconnected |
| Nodes | Number of nodes in cluster |
| Database | Database connection info (driver://host/db) |

# PART 33: AI ASSISTANT RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**These rules govern how AI assistants work on projects using this specification.**

## CRITICAL: Specification Drift is Unacceptable

**AI assistants drift from specifications over time.** This means:
- Gradually deviating from documented requirements
- Inventing new patterns not in the spec
- Forgetting constraints after working for a while
- "Improving" things that don't need improvement

**This drift is the #1 cause of specification violations. Combat it actively.**

## Template File vs AI.md

| File | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **Template file** | **NEVER MODIFY** | Read-only master (may be named TEMPLATE.md, SPEC.md, etc.) |
| **AI.md** | Create/Update | Project-specific specification |
| **TODO.AI.md** | Create/Update | Task tracking |

**How to identify the template file:**
- Location varies: project root, org root, different org, ~/, or user-specified
- Contains unreplaced `zipcodes`, `apimgr` variables
- Contains "HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE" section
- Contains multiple "PART X:" numbered sections

**Workflow:**
1. If `AI.md` doesn't exist → Copy from template, replace variables
2. If `AI.md` exists → Read it, update if outdated
3. If old spec files exist in project repo → Merge into `AI.md`, DELETE old files

## Mandatory Compliance Schedule

| When | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Session start** | Read AI.md completely | Understand full context |
| **Before EACH task** | Re-read relevant PART(s) | Prevent drift |
| **Every 3-5 changes** | Stop, verify against spec | Catch drift early |
| **Before task completion** | Full compliance check | Ensure correctness |
| **When uncertain** | Re-read spec or ASK | Never guess |

**You MUST re-read the spec before implementing. Do NOT rely on memory.**

## Before Starting Work

1. **Identify template vs AI.md** - template is read-only, AI.md is project spec
2. **NEVER modify template file** - location varies, but it's always read-only
3. **Read AI.md COMPLETELY** - not just parts you think are relevant
4. **If AI.md missing** - create from template, replace all variables
5. **If AI.md outdated** - update to reflect current template
6. **Check TODO.AI.md** - see pending tasks and their priority
7. **Verify understanding** - if ANYTHING is unclear, ASK first
8. **Never assume** - when in doubt, ask the user

## During Work

1. **Re-read spec before EACH implementation** - every single time
2. **Follow spec EXACTLY** - no "improvements" without explicit permission
3. **Check yourself every 3-5 changes** - am I drifting?
4. **Update TODO.AI.md** as tasks are completed
5. **Test your changes** - don't commit untested code
6. **Keep changes focused** - one feature/fix per task
7. **If uncertain** - STOP, re-read spec, or ASK

## After Work

1. **Update AI.md** if architecture or rules changed
2. **Update TODO.AI.md** with any new tasks discovered
3. **Verify compliance** - check against the FINAL CHECKPOINT
4. **NEVER modify template file** - changes go in AI.md only

## Common Drift Patterns to Avoid

| Drift Pattern | What You Think | What You Should Do |
|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Pattern improvement | "This pattern is better" | Use the pattern in spec |
| Format change | "This format is cleaner" | Use the format in spec |
| Memory reliance | "I remember it says..." | Re-read the actual spec |
| Assumption | "Obviously they want..." | Check spec, ask if unclear |
| Feature addition | "This would be helpful" | Only do what's requested |
| Spec correction | "The spec is wrong here" | Ask before any deviation |

## Attribution

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **NEVER** | Include AI attribution in code, comments, commits, or documentation |
| **NEVER** | "authored by Claude", "generated by AI", "Co-Authored-By: Claude" |
| **ALWAYS** | Code should appear as if written by a human developer |

## Tool Access

| Access | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Full | All tools available |
| **EXCEPT** | `git push`, `git commit` - require explicit user request |
| Allowed | Stage files, create branches, check status, diff |
| Required | User must explicitly request commits and pushes |

## Prohibited Actions

| Action | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| **Modifying TEMPLATE.md** | **Read-only master template - NEVER modify** |
| `git push` without asking | May push unreviewed code |
| `git commit` without asking | User should review changes first |
| Deleting files without confirmation | Destructive action |
| Changing NON-NEGOTIABLE sections | Specification violation |
| Skipping validation | Security requirement |
| Hardcoding secrets | Security vulnerability |
| Using deprecated APIs | Maintainability issue |

## Code Style Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Comment Placement

**Comments MUST always be placed ABOVE the code they describe. NEVER inline or below.**

| Placement | Allowed |
|-----------|---------|
| Above code | YES |
| Inline (same line) | NO |
| Below code | NO |

**Correct:**
```go
// Calculate the total price including tax
total := price * (1 + taxRate)

// User configuration options
type Config struct {
    // Server port number
    Port int
    // Enable debug mode
    Debug bool
}
```

**Incorrect:**
```go
total := price * (1 + taxRate) // Calculate total price - WRONG

total := price * (1 + taxRate)
// Calculate total price - WRONG (below)

type Config struct {
    Port int  // Server port - WRONG (inline)
    Debug bool // Debug mode - WRONG (inline)
}
```

**YAML comments - same rule:**
```yaml
# Enable multi-user mode
enabled: false

# Allow public registration
registration:
  enabled: false
```

### Code Quality Rules

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **No magic numbers** | Use named constants |
| **No hardcoded strings** | Use constants or config |
| **Error handling** | Always handle errors, never ignore |
| **Input validation** | Validate ALL user input |
| **SQL injection** | Use parameterized queries only |
| **XSS prevention** | Escape all output in templates |
| **CSRF protection** | All forms must have CSRF tokens |

### File Organization

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **One package per directory** | Standard Go convention |
| **Meaningful names** | `user.go` not `u.go` |
| **Group related code** | Keep related functions together |
| **Separate concerns** | Don't mix handlers with business logic |

## Handling Ambiguity

When the specification is unclear:

1. **Check if clarified elsewhere** - search the full spec
2. **Look for similar patterns** - how are similar features handled?
3. **Ask the user** - don't guess
4. **Document the decision** - add to AI.md for future reference

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Correct Approach |
|---------|------------------|
| Implementing without reading spec | Read relevant PART first |
| Assuming default values | Check spec for defined defaults |
| Using .yaml instead of .yml | Always use `server.yml` |
| Inline comments | Comments above code only |
| Skipping admin panel | ALL settings need admin UI |
| Forgetting mobile-first | Start with mobile, expand to desktop |
| Using JavaScript alerts | Use proper notification system |
| Inline CSS | Use CSS files/classes only |
